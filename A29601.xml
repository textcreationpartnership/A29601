            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis little Treatiſe is but the firſt Part of an intended lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Work, the Deſign where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as appears in the Title-Page) is to exhibit, as in a Mirror, a view of the ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern State not only of this our Iſland of <hi>GREAT BRITAIN,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and all other His <hi>MAJESTIES</hi> Dominions and Territories: not by writing a continued Chronicle or Hiſtory of all the Kings or Princes, reigning ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them; but only by giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch ſignal Mutations, as made any conſiderable Change in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Government either in Church or State.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95482:3"/>
            <p>In this part (which treats of <hi>Britain</hi> in general) after a ſhort Deſcription of the Iſland, and a brief Account of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inhabitants thereof (from whom not only our preſent <hi>Cambro-Britains,</hi> but thoſe alſo of <hi>Armorica</hi> or little <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>France</hi> are deſcended) is inſerted a Diſcourſe (which, tho it may ſeem a Digreſſion, is neither long nor imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) touching the Original and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government, to which and none other, this our Iſland has been ſo fortunate, as to have been Subjected from its very firſt being inhabited to this very Day.</p>
            <p>Hereunto I was forced by the audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Scribles of certain profligate Wretches, who, that they may the eaſilier inſtigate the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgar to a contempt of the Sacred Authority of their Prince, and thereby make way for the overturning of this famous <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Popular Tyranny in its place, endeavour to debaſe Monarchy it ſelf, affirming <hi>the moſt High and Sacred Order of Kings, which is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of GOD himſelf, founded in the prime Laws of Nature, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed by expreſs Texts both of the Old and New Teſtaments,</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:95482:3"/> be a meer human Creature, taking its Original from the Conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by whom Soveraignty is conveyed unto Kings in truſt only, and by Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently that the People may (whenſoever they pleaſe) reſume this Power, and call their Truſtees to an account.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the pernicious Maxims, which ſo lately intoxicated the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and are now again for the like purpoſe taken up by our preſent Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, and daily diſperſt by the ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pamphleteers of theſe times, one of which (who inſolently preſumes to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his treaſonable Libels to a moſt Noble and Loyal Peer) falls foul upon the Learned <hi>Sr. Robert Filmer</hi> for deriving the Regal Authority from the paternal, inſtituted by <hi>GOD</hi> himſelf; tho this verity be not only expreſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Holy Scriptures, which declare, that the firſt Government in the World was <hi>Monarchical</hi> in the Father of all Fleſh, but was by the very glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Natural Reaſon diſcovered by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who, ſpeaking of the Original of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> ſaith: <hi>The firſt Society made of many Houſes is a Village, which ſeems moſt agreeable to nature,
<pb facs="tcp:95482:4"/> as being a Colony of Families, which ſome call Foſter-brethren, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Childrens Children. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at firſt Cities were, and now alſo Nations are Governed by Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch came together, as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Kingly Government. For the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in every Houſe is King, and ſo for Kindred ſake it is in Colonies, that is, in more Families, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the ſame Houſe: whence</hi> Homer <hi>ſaith, Every man gives Laws to his Wives and Children.</hi> Hence it is by all ancient Writers acknowledged, that the firſt Commonweals were governed by <hi>Monarchs;</hi> nor indeed was there any other Government known in the World for above three thouſand years, till ſome ambitious Fellows among the giddy <hi>Grecians,</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alwayes delighted in Novelties, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt their Soveraigns, and uſurped their Authority; as was lately here done by the Rump-Parliament, and is now again aimed at by the Factors for the <hi>Good-Old-Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better to excite my fellow Subjects to a dutiful Submiſſion to our common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King, I have reminded them, that all thoſe Rights and Priviledges, to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whereof (tho neither infringed,
<pb facs="tcp:95482:4"/> nor in danger of being ſo) the popular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues pretend to call them forth, when their real deſign is utterly to deſtroy and take away both the Regal Prerogative and the Peoples Liberties, are originally the Conceſſions of their Princes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, as it is the height of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to employ the Favours of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign to the diſturbance of his Government: ſo it is an exceſs of Folly, to think to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Liberties by the pulling down or weakning that Authority, which, as it firſt gave them, ſo is alone capable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and maintain them. This, tho it may ſeem ſtrange to thoſe, that have their Heads filled with the Chimerical Conceits of the natural Freedom and Equality of Mankind, and the firſt founding of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by the Multitude, upon ſuch Terms and Conditions, as to their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſeemed fit, is yet clearly manifeſt from the Hiſtories and Records of all Ages and Nations, and particularly of this Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> of which it was well obſerved by the late Lord Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Bridgman,</hi> then Lord chief Baron, at the Tryal of the Regicides: <hi>It is true we have as great Liberties, as any People have in</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>in the World: but let us own them, where they are due.
<pb facs="tcp:95482:5"/> We have them by the Conceſſions of our Princes. Our Princes have granted them: and the King now, He in them hath granted them likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Account of the Original and Excellency of Monarchy, to which Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment alone, I briefly ſhew, that this Iſland has been alwayes ſubjected, I proceed to the Conqueſt thereof by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and thence to ſuch other Mutations, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein unto the time of <hi>Cadwalladar,</hi> who in the Year <hi>689</hi> quitting his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of which the <hi>Saxons</hi> had gotten the beſt part, a Period was put to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarchy, the very Name of King of <hi>Britain</hi> not being ſo much as heard of till the happy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Succeſſion of His Majeſties Grandfather King <hi>James</hi> of famous Memory to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Genealogy from <hi>Cadwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladar</hi> I have here ſet down, clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating his preſent Sacred Majeſty to be the true and undoubted Heir of the ſaid <hi>Britiſh</hi> King, as he is alſo of the <hi>Saxon, Norman,</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Kings, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to have a clearer Right to this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> than any private man can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>After this Relation of ſuch Mutations,
<pb facs="tcp:95482:5"/> as concern <hi>Britain</hi> in general, I give a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Account of the preſent Government of this Iſland. And here according to my Duty, and the Oath of Supremacy, which declaring the King to be the only Supreme Governour, admits neither Equal nor Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, I aſſert the Soveraignty of our Lord the King, and ſhew, that there is not in our (nor can indeed be in any) <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> any Authority, but what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the <hi>Monarch,</hi> in oppoſition to the pernicious Doctrine of Coordinacy, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Ringleaders of the Faction diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed amongſt the People, and endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be juſtified by the Author of <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> and <hi>T. H.</hi> the former of which, ſpeaking of the late Parliamentary Rebellion, ſaith: <hi>This is certain, that whereever two Coordinate Powers do differ, and there be no Power on earth to reconcile them otherwiſe, nor Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they will,</hi> de facto, <hi>fall together by the ears.</hi> And the latter not only tells us in expreſs terms, that <hi>the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment derive their Power and Authority from the ſame Original, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives His;</hi> but by affirming, that there are Treaſons of State other than thoſe, that are declared by the Statutes, and ſuch as the King cannot pardon, would proſtitute
<pb facs="tcp:95482:6"/> the Lives of all his fellow Subjects to the Arbitrary Power of any prevailing Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may at any time happen to be in the two Houſes of Parliament, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the Houſe of Commons alone, <hi>the onely part</hi> (if we will believe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Plato Redivivus) which is now left intire of the old Conſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe the Heads of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they might leave no Stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, which might be made uſe of for the battering down of this Hereditary Monarchy, have eſſayed to ſubvert it by impeaching the Deſcent of the Crown in the Right Line, I have treated upon the of late much controverted Point of the Succeſſion, which I have demonſtrated to be unalterable by any Statute or Act of Parliament whatever, and as ſuch to have been acknowledged by all our Ancient Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, that were neither over-awed by Force, nor ſeduced by Faction.</p>
            <p>Having thus, with what Brevity I could, handled theſe foregoing matters, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Part with a ſhort account of the preſent <hi>Monarch</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> Our Soveraign Lord the KING now Reigning (whom GOD long preſerve to the Conſolation and Happineſs of this Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) of his Queen, and the Princes of his Royal Blood.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95482:6"/>
            <p>And becauſe the ill-willers to the Peace of this our <hi>Iſrael</hi> have raiſed in the minds of the unthinking Vulgar terrible Fears and Apprehenſions of his Royal Highneſs, whom, the readilier to ſtir up againſt him the Animoſity of the people, they have audaciouſly loaded with all the Calumnies and Scandals, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Men or Devils could invent, I have endeavoured by a true (tho imperfect) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of his Geſts and Character to remove that Prejudice, which theſe horrid and malicious Falſities may have created a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in the Spirits of the unwary.</p>
            <p>If theſe my Endeavors ſhall prove uſeful for the reducing of any of my deluded Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen to that natural Obedience, which we owe to our Soveraign, I ſhall repute my ſelf abundantly ſatisfied for my pains, and ſhall be encouraged to compleat the reſt of my deſigned Work.</p>

It hath indeed ſuch a conſtant continuance of all ſorts of neceſſary Food, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, which ſo often ravages other Countreys, has ſcarce been felt here theſe four hundred years.

               <p>As this Iſland affords its Inhabitants all neceſſary Food for the ſupport of their Life: ſo it yields them plenty of Rayment for their defence againſt the Injuries of the Weather. For it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth (eſpecially in the South part called <hi>England</hi>) not only very fine Wooll, making excellently laſting, and well-conditioned Cloth; but alſo ſuch great abundance thereof, as ſerves not only for the Cloathing of all ſorts of People from the higheſt to the loweſt; but being manufactured into Cloth and Stuffs, is diſperſed all over the World, but eſpecially into <hi>High-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Muſcovia, Turky,</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> to the great benefit of its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
               <p>And as it thus abounds with Wool: ſo hath it Linen made therein, inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to none for its Goodneſs; nor would it need ſupply thereof from elſewhere for any uſe whatever, were the people but ſo induſtrious, as they might be, in ſowing Flax and Hemp, for the producing whereof they want not fitting Ground, tho there be at preſent (through their Sloth in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to improve it) much Linen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the ſhame and damage of the Nation.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95482:20"/>
               <p>The Abundance of Cattel here ſlain furniſhes the People with great ſtore of excellent Leather for all ſorts of Uſes; inſomuch that the pooreſt of them were good Leathern Shooes, whereas in the neighboring Countries they either wear Wooden Shooes, or none at all.</p>
               <p>For building it wants not any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Materials, being well ſtored with Timber, Iron, Brick, Tiles, Slate, Lime, Lead, Glaſs, and Stone, of which our fine <hi>Portland</hi> Stone is not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Marble.</p>
               <p>For fewel there is either Wood, Sea-Coal, or Pit-Coal, almoſt everywhere to be had at reaſonable rates; and where this is wanting, they burn Turfs or Peats.</p>
               <p>For Shipping there is no where better Oak, no where ſuch Knee-timber, as the Shipwrights call it; or Iron to make ſerviceable Guns.</p>
               <p>For War, Journeys, and Hunting; for Plow, Cart, and Carriages, there is ſuch abundant plenty of Horſes, that Aſſes and Mules, ſo frequently made uſe of in <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> are here utterly deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>Dogs it hath of all ſorts, ſizes and

               <p>It produceth likewiſe, beſides a mighty quantity of Tynn, Lead and Iron, ſome Braſs and Copper, and hath alſo Quickſilver, Antimony, Sulphur, Black-Lead, Orpiment red and yellow, Allom, Salt, Hops, Saff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Liquoris, and divers other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Commodities: and has ſeveral Silver-Mines, richer than thoſe of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſi</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> whence the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has moſt of his Silver: thoſe yielding uſually but an Ounce and an half of Silver in an hundred Ounces of Oar; and theſe ordinarily ſix or eight Ounces <hi>per Cent.</hi> But theſe Mines, lying deep, are hard to come unto, which in <hi>Potoſi</hi> is otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And (as if all this were not ſufficient) it yieldeth Phyſick likewiſe to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, having in it Hot Baths for the eaſe of Maims, Bruiſes, inward<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95482:21"/> Aches and Paines, and abounding in Medicinal Springs.</p>
               <p>And altho there be not much Wine made here at preſent, yet, if we ſhall conſider, that Vineyards were heretofore common in moſt of the Southern and middle parts of <hi>England,</hi> we ſhall eaſily be induced to attribute this Defect (if it be any) to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter improvement of our Ground, and the cheap and eaſy Importation of that and other forreign Commodities, the Advantages, it hath from all parts of the World to take in Trade and Merchandize, being ſo great, as abundantly verifies that of the Old Poet:

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Inhabitants: Of the Laws, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Manners, and Puniſhments of the Antient <hi>Britains;</hi> Of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Stature, Diet, Attire, Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Traffick, Shipping, Coins, and Buildings; Of their Arms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Fighting: Of their Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time.</head>
               <p>BRITAIN, being a Country,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> ſo rich in Commodities, ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſituation, and ſo well ſtored with every thing, neceſſary for the ſupport of Human Life, that, if the World had been by its omnipotent Creator faſhioned like a Ring, as it is like a Globe, ſhe might well have been eſteemed the only Gemme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: it is no wonder, that ſhe has been poſſeſt by many Nations, and coveted by many more; and that, whereas ſome Countries are ſtill held by their <hi>Aborigines,</hi> or the firſt, that laid claim to them, it ſhould be a matter of no ſmall difficulty to find out the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Iſland.</p>
               <p>The firſt Inhabitants of the Iſland,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95482:23"/> now called <hi>Great Britain,</hi> had their Original (as may be reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured from their calling themſelves <hi>Kumero, Cymro,</hi> and <hi>Kumeri,</hi> which Name was ſo ancient amongſt them, that <hi>Cymro</hi> and <hi>Cymri</hi> doth now ſignifie as much as <hi>Aborigines</hi>) from the <hi>Cimbri</hi> of the Continent, who are ſuppoſed to be the Relicks of the ancient <hi>Cimmerii,</hi> that, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Scythia</hi> into the Countries, afterwards called <hi>Sarmatia</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and eſtabliſhing themſelves upon the Sea-coaſts of <hi>Gaul,</hi> paſſed over into this Iſland likewiſe, and here ſeated themſelves. But in proceſs of time, and before the Dayes of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> Valor decreaſing, the <hi>Gauls,</hi> increaſing in Number and Power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their antient Seats, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded into <hi>Britain</hi> alſo, and invaded part of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> who had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore placed themſelves in this Iſland; and altho they obtained the Sea-coaſts, and entred far into the Inland parts, and ſo by long poſſeſſion came to be called <hi>Britains,</hi> yet they were by the more antient Inhabitants, who eſteemed themſelves the only <hi>Aborigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of the Iſland, looked upon only as Incroachers.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95482:23"/>
               <p>Soon after (if not contemporary with the <hi>Cimbri</hi>) are the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> ſuppoſed to have been in this Iſland, who, being in the firſt Ages of the World the beſt, if not only Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, paſſing through the <hi>Straits</hi> to diſcover the Weſtern Seas, firſt of all the Inhabitants of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> found out theſe Iſlands, arriving firſt at the Iſles of <hi>Scilly,</hi> which finding to abound with Tynn, they called in their Language <hi>Bratanac,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> by a Word of like ſignification ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Caſſiterides.</hi> The <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diſcovering the Weſtern parts of this Iſland, now called <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> the ſame name was communicated thereunto, and by Degrees to all the Iſlands, ſituated in the Weſtern Ocean.</p>
               <p>The Uſefulneſs of thoſe excellent Commodities, brought by the <hi>Phaenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> from <hi>Britain,</hi> rendred the <hi>Greeks</hi> very curious in ſearch of the Place, from whence they came, which the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> as ſtudiouſly concealed from them: Yet <hi>Colaeus</hi> having diſcovered the Weſtern Seas, the <hi>Greeks</hi> found out theſe Iſlands, where they ſetled vaſt Colonies, landing firſt at <hi>Man</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95482:24"/> and <hi>Angleſey,</hi> and introduced into the whole Iſland a great number of their Religious Ceremonies, and other Cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms.</p>
               <p>In the Year of the World 3913. <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> being offended with the <hi>Britains</hi> for having under-hand aſſiſted his Enemies the <hi>Gauls,</hi> invaded this Nation, but may be ſaid rather to have diſcovered it, than conquered it: from which he was ſo far, that <hi>Lucan</hi> ſayes poſitively of him,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Territa quaeſitis oſtendit terga</hi> Britannis. But afterwards in the Time of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> the Southern Parts of it were made a <hi>Roman</hi> Province.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> being thus partly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſome of them, impatient of ſubjection, ſheltring themſelves behind the <hi>Cheviot</hi> Hills, and Mount <hi>Grampius,</hi> infeſted the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Colonies, and retaining the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtom of painting themſelves, when the other <hi>Britains,</hi> now civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, had left it off, were diſtinguiſhed by the Name of <hi>Picts,</hi> thoſe only being called <hi>Britains,</hi> who were under the <hi>Romans</hi> Juriſdiction. Theſe <hi>Picts</hi> inhabited the more Southern Parts of ſo much of the Iſland, as was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95482:24"/> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the more Northern parts being long before poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who <hi>Anno mundi</hi> 3641. coming out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there, and called it <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire the <hi>Britains,</hi> deſerted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and weakned by the many Armies, they had drawn from them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> did in the Reign of King <hi>Vortigern</hi> call in the <hi>Saxons</hi> to their Aſſiſtance, who by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees poſſeſt themſelves of all the flouriſhing parts of the Iſland, driving the <hi>Britains</hi> into the mountainous Parts of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the Laws,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Laws.</note> whereby the Antient <hi>Britains</hi> were governed, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that have come to our knowledg, are ſeven, ſaid to have been made by <hi>Molmutius Dunwallo,</hi> tranſlated out of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſpeech in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Gildas,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the <hi>Engliſh Saxon</hi> by King <hi>Alfred.</hi> They are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Temples of the Gods ſhould enjoy ſuch Priviledges, that whatever Malefactor ſhould fly thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95482:25"/> for Sanctuary, ſhould not be forced from thence, till he had obtained Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his Crime.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Wayes, leading to the Temples, and the Roads of great Cities, ſhould have like Priviledges.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Plows, Oxen, and other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Cattle ſhould enjoy the like Immunities, leſt, the Ground being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled, the People might periſh for want of Bread.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That a certain number of Plows ſhould be uſed in every County of the Land, with ſevere Penalties to be inflicted upon thoſe, that ſhould leſſen the Number.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That no Oxen or laboring Beaſts ſhould be ſeized for Debt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That Buying and Selling ſhould be by certain ſet Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That Thieves and Robbers ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Religion.</note>The great Goodneſs and Wiſdom of GOD having created Man for the Enjoyment of himſelf, and all other things for the uſe and ſervice of Man in order to his attaining of this ſublime End, it is but juſt, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95482:25"/> Man ſhould pay a Soveraign Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reſpect to this bounteous Creator, and a punctual Obedience to all his Commands. The true Manner of performing this Adoration was by <hi>Adam,</hi> who received it of GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, taught his Poſterity; but they deviating from his Precepts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming guilty of all ſorts of Impieties, the Almighty ſent an univerſal Deluge, which waſht away all Mankind (eight Perſons only excepted) from off the Face of the Earth.</p>
               <p>The Poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> who with his Wife, his three Sons, and their Wives, alone eſcaped this common Calamity, too ſoon forgetting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Puniſhment, inflicted upon the former Generation of Men for their Irreligion, left the Service of the true Deity, adoring the Inventions of their own Heads, and the Works of their own Hands: ſo that amongſt all the Inhabitants of the Earth there were antiently none but the <hi>Jews,</hi> who Worſhipt the true GOD in the true manner.</p>
               <p>No wonder then, that the Religion of the antient <hi>Britains</hi> was <hi>Paganiſh</hi> Superſtition, they having many Idol-Gods,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95482:26"/> the chief whereof were theſe, that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Taramis,</hi> or the <hi>Thunderer,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to whom, as to many other of their Gods, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered human Sacrifices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Tutates,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> who was eſteemed the Inventor of all Arts and Sciences, and particularly of Letters, and the Sickle; as alſo the Leader in in all Journeys, and Guide in all Wayes; and whoſe Patronage was eſteemed to be of a wonderful Efficacy for promoting Gain in Mony, or any kind of Merchandize. To his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour there were Mounts caſt up, and conſecrated, eſpecially where many Wayes met, and his Statue erected upon them, pointing to the Wayes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Heſus,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Mars,</hi> the God of War and Peace, called alſo <hi>Camulus:</hi> from whom came <hi>Camu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodunum</hi> or <hi>Mars-Hill,</hi> now <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> To him alſo were Men ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Hues,</hi> or <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whoſe Prieſts were called <hi>Eubages.</hi> Of the Feaſts of this God <hi>Pliny</hi> is ſuppoſed to ſpeak, where he ſaies, <hi>That the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>died themſelves like</hi> Aethiopians
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95482:26"/> 
                  <hi>at ſome ſolemn Sacrifices, and performed their Worſhip with Men and Women go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Belenus,</hi> who was the ſame with <hi>Apollo,</hi> repreſented by the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> with an Harp. His Prieſts were called <hi>Paterae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Beliſama,</hi> or the Moon, <hi>The Queen of Heaven,</hi> viz. <hi>Diana,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Apollo,</hi> called alſo <hi>Ardurena</hi> and <hi>Ardoena,</hi> the Goddeſs of Woods and Mountains. She had ſomtime a Temple in <hi>London,</hi> where now ſtands the Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Onvana,</hi> or <hi>Minerva,</hi> to whoſe Honour there was a Temple erected, where is now the Cathedral of <hi>Bath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Adraſte,</hi> or the Goddeſs of Victory, ſuppoſed to be the ſame with the <hi>Venus armata</hi> of the <hi>Cytheraei</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and the <hi>Venus Victrix</hi> of the <hi>Romans.</hi> In Temples, and in Groves, called by her Name the Groves of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> they ſacrificed to her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners alive.</p>
               <p>They are thought alſo to have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> to whom and other Infernal Deities were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Nocturnal Sacrifices, where
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95482:27"/> many abominable Luſts, and horrid Villanies were committed.</p>
               <p>In theſe parts likewiſe was Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped <hi>Ogmius</hi> or the <hi>Phoenician Hercules,</hi> who was repreſented an Old and decrepit Man, bald-pated, white-haired, wrincle-skinned, and Sun-burnt, having a Globe in one hand, and a pair of Compaſſes in the other.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe they had alſo for Gods <hi>Portenta</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gildas) ipſa dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolica paene numero</hi> Aegyptiaca <hi>vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> Many ugly Spectres, meerly Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, exceeding in number even thoſe of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Some of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations were remaining even to his dayes in the Ruines of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, having deformed Lineaments, and ſtern and grim Countenances.</p>
               <p>For the performance of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and other Superſtitious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of their Idolatrous Religion, they had many Prieſts and Inſtructers, the chief whereof were the <hi>Bards</hi> and the <hi>Druids.</hi> The <hi>Bards,</hi> who are juſtly eſteemed the moſt ancient Order in <hi>Britain,</hi> and were long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Druids,</hi> being ſuppoſed to have their Original from the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> were made uſe of in the Deify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95482:27"/> of Great Men, compoſing in Verſe the Praiſes of the Gods and Heroes, and the whole Body of their Divinity: till that, the <hi>Druids,</hi> who were brought in by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the upper hand, they degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by degrees into common Ballad-ſingers, and thoſe, that before ſang of the Immortality and Eſſence of the Soul, the Praiſes of the Gods, and the <hi>Encomiums</hi> and Vertues of Great Men, gave themſelves up now to the compoſing of Myſtical Rimes, Charms, Spels, and Incantations: to which, as the <hi>Britains</hi> of old, ſo the <hi>Welſh</hi> are even at this day prodigiouſly addicted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Druids,</hi> ſucceeding, did not totally aboliſh the Cuſtoms and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Bards,</hi> but retained the moſt uſeful of them, particularly the Doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul, to which they added that of its Tranſmigration, firſt taught by <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> about whoſe Time, or not long after, the <hi>Greeks</hi> are ſuppoſed to have entred this Iſland. Theſe grew ſo powerful, that they not only became the ſole Interpreters of Religion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily preſent in the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95482:28"/> without whom neither publick nor private Sacrifices could be performed; but were made Judges alſo of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and Crimes, and abſolute Determiners of all Diſputes about Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances and Bounds of Lands, iſſuing out their Excommunications for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of their Decrees even upon the Temporal Magiſtrates themſelves, and making themſelves feared by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in their power to determin, whoſe Blood would be the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sacrifice to the Gods. No wonder therefore, that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from War, and Taxes, and enjoyed many other great Priviledges and Immunities.</p>
               <p>Their Juriſdiction extended over the whole Iſland and ſome part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> and they were ſubject to two Primates: one of which, under whom were the Northern <hi>Druids,</hi> had his Reſidence in the Iſle of <hi>Man;</hi> the other, under whom were the Southern, in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſey.</hi> Yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> writes, that they were ſubject but to one Chief, who was conſtituted by Election. This being a Place of Great Repute, there were in its vacancy many Competitors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Secular Power was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95482:28"/> ſometimes engaged in the Quarrel, each Prince endeavouring to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Authority by advancing a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of his own to that Seat. They had once a year a ſolemn Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Chartres</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> but their chief Reſidences were in the Iſles of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Angleſey,</hi> whither reſorted both from <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul</hi> thoſe, who deſired to be initiated in their Ceremonies, where they continued ſometimes near twenty years to be inſtructed in the Myſteries of their Religion, which they were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to carry away any otherwiſe, than in their Memories. When <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> was invaded by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the the Southern <hi>Druids</hi> retired to <hi>Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> and the Northern to <hi>Man:</hi> at length thoſe of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> being driven out of their Seat, repaired likewiſe to <hi>Man,</hi> where they continued till ſuch time, as King <hi>Cratilinth Anno Domini</hi> 277. with great difficulty expelled them.</p>
               <p>They taught among other things, that the Life of a Man, either in a deſperate Sickneſs, or in the Perils of War, could not be ſecured, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs another ſuffered in his ſtead:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95482:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> wherefore in ſuch Caſes they either ſacrificed Men, or vowed ſo do after their delivery. The moſt acceptable Sacrifice to their Gods were eſteemed Murtherers, Robbers, and ſuch like Criminals, but where thoſe were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Innocents often ſuffered. They made in ſome places the Image or Statue of a Man, the Limbs whereof were made of Oſier Twigs, woven together like Basket-ware: this they filled with live Men, and ſetting it on fire, cauſed the poor Creatures to periſh in the Flames and Smoak.</p>
               <p>The firſt Occaſion of erecting theſe Wicker Images is ſuppoſed to have been in Deteſtation of the Slavery, they ſuffered under the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who, being Men of a vaſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Stature, had for a long time ſubdued, and kept them under, and were (no doubt) thoſe Giants, whom the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtories ſay to have ſo long infeſted the Land. The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of whoſe being in <hi>Cornwall</hi> was preſerved to the dayes of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villan</hi> the Poet, who lived about four hundred years ſince. Whoſe Verſes concerning <hi>Cornwall</hi> are theſe.</p>

This was by them gathered with many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Ceremonies and great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. 1.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95482:30"/> they brought thither two young Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks milk-white, whoſe Horns were then, and not before, bound up. 3.

               <p>The Inlanders had all things amongſt them in common, and would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any Propriety, inſomuch that ten or twelve of them promiſcuouſly made uſe of the ſame Women, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with Brethren, and Parents with their own Children, the Iſſue, which was bred up by a common Stock, being more particularly reputed his, who had the firſt Enjoyment of the Mothers Virgin Embraces.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note>The Original and firſt Inſtitution of this moſt excellent Government was from GOD himſelf; who, having
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95482:39"/> created <hi>Adam,</hi> commanded him <hi>to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, and repleniſh the Earth, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it, and to have Dominion over all Creatures,</hi> conſtituting him thereby Monarch of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>The Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> had no Right to poſſeſs any thing, but by Grant or Permiſſion from him, or Succeſſion to him, who, when his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren grew up, and came to have Children of their own, over whom they alſo had a Command and Power, aſſigned them their diſtinct Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by Right of private Dominion, yet ſtill with Subordination to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was Lord-paramount over his Childrens Children to all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Abſurd therefore is the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thoſe, who imagin an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Multitude, having a natural Right to Community: A thing, which never had any Being, but in the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maerical</hi> Brains of the Aſſertors. An Opinion this is, which cannot be maintained without the great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and opening a Door to <hi>Atheiſme</hi> by denying the Creation of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> then was Father, King, and Lord over his Family; a Son, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95482:40"/> a Servant, a Slave, were then one and the ſame thing. Nor was he tied to govern by any Laws, but that, which was by his Creator im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in his Breaſt, called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law of Nature, which if he tranſgreſſed, he (as all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monarchs) was accountable to GOD alone, from whom he received it.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Adam</hi> this Right of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty was to deſcend to his eldeſt Son, to whom GOD himſelf (even in his Fathers Life-time) ſpeaking of his younger Brother, ſaid: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee ſhall his Deſires be ſubject, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Foundation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment before the Univerſal Deluge: which (waſhing away all the reſt of Mankind from the face of the Earth) left this Univerſal Soveraignty to <hi>Noah,</hi> who with his Wife, his Sons, and their Wives, only remained alive. By <hi>Noah</hi> was the whole World divided amongſt his three Sons: From one of which, their Sons, or Nephews, ſcattered abroad after the Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> do moſt of the civileſt Nations of the Earth labour to deduce their Original.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:95482:40"/>
               <p>The Poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> to ſecure themſelves (as they thought) from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed by another Flood, went about to erect a Tower, the Top whereof, they intended, ſhould reach up to Heaven. But to ſhew, how vain all humane Deſignments are, which think to conteſt with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Divine Providence, the Almighty ſent amongſt them a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Tongues, and diſperſed thoſe, who were congregated into one place, over the Face of the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>By this Diſperſion there were (according to the generally-received Opinion) ſeventy two diſtinct Nations erected, all which were not confuſed Multitudes, left at Liberty to chooſe what Governors or Government they liſted; but ſo careful was GOD even in that Confuſion to preſerve the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and <hi>Monarchical</hi> Authority, that he diſtributed the Diverſity of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages according to the Diverſity of Families, having Fathers for Rulers over them. This appears plainly in the ſacred Text, where, after the Enumeration of the Sons and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Japheth,</hi> immediately follow
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95482:41"/> theſe Words: <hi>By theſe were the Iſles of the Gentiles divided in their Lands: every one after his Tongue, after their Families, in their Nations.</hi> So again of the Children of <hi>Ham</hi> it is ſaid: <hi>Theſe are the Sons of</hi> Ham, <hi>after their Families, after their Tongues, in their Countreys, and in their Nations.</hi> And again of the Children of <hi>Shem: Theſe are the Sons of</hi> Shem, <hi>after their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, after their Tongues, in their Lands, after their Nations.</hi> The Concluſion of the whole being thus: <hi>Theſe are the Families of the Sons of</hi> Noah, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Generations, in their Nations: and by theſe were the Nations divided in the Earth, after the Flood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However therefore the Manner, uſed by <hi>Noah</hi> in the Diſtribution of the Earth amongſt his Poſterity, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; yet moſt certain it is, that the Diviſion it ſelf was by Families from <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children, over which the Fathers were Rulers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying as abſolute an Authority and Dominion, as ever any Monarch ſince the Creation pretended to.</p>
               <p>Agreeably to this Account of the Original of Monarchy, delivered in in holy Scripture, doth <hi>Plato</hi> in his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95482:41"/> third Book of Laws affirm, that <hi>the true and firſt Reaſon of Authority is, that the Father and Mother, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thoſe, that beget and ingender, do command and rule over all their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Groundleſs therefore is that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, which ſome men make of <hi>Monarchy</hi> into <hi>Deſpotical</hi> and <hi>Paternal:</hi> ſince no Maſter has Right to exact a more abſolute and unlimited Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from his Slave, than is due from the Child to the Father.</p>
               <p>Of the Abſoluteneſs of this Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juriſdiction Examples are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Holy Writ. Thus we find, that <hi>Abraham</hi> commanded an Army of three hundred and eighteen Souldiers of his own Family; and that <hi>Eſau</hi> met his Brother <hi>Jacob</hi> with four hundred Men at Arms. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> concluded a Peace with <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> and ratified the Articles by Oath. Thus <hi>Judah</hi> ſentenced <hi>Thamar,</hi> his Daughter-in-Law, to be burnt for playing the Harlot. Which three Acts of making War, concluding Peace, and giving Judgment of Life or Death, are the chief marks of Soveraignty, that can be found in any <hi>Monarch.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95482:42"/>
               <p>As the Original therefore of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> was of Divine Inſtitution: ſo its Power was uncontrollable; nor can it be otherwiſe without the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Government it ſelf. Rightly then (whatever <hi>Milton</hi> in his Juſtification of the blackeſt Treaſon, that ever Eye beheld, ſayes to the contrary) is a King defined by <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius He, who has the Supreme Power in the Kingdom, accountable to none but GOD, who may do, what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and is free from the Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ridiculous then (if not Malicious) are the clamors of thoſe, who daily fill the World with Outcries againſt Arbitrary Power: For there never was, nor ever can be any People go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned without a Power of Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Power muſt of neceſſity be Arbitrary, and is an inſeparable Concomitant of the Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or Governors, and muſt therefore in a Monarchy reſide in one.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion then is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſhall be an Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without which not any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can one Moment ſubſiſt; but who ſhall have this Arbitrary Power, whether one man, or many: that is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95482:42"/> in effect, whether the Government ſhall be <hi>Monarchical,</hi> or not?</p>
               <p>Nay it has been ſeen, that thoſe very Perſons, who clamored ſo much (and with ſo little reaſon) againſt an Arbitrary Power in their Prince, have themſelves exerciſed the Height of Arbitrary Power over their fellow Subjects, puniſhing them by Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and other Penalties, not for the Breach of any known and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Laws; but of unknown and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Priviledges: and aſcending to that Exceſs of Inſolence, as (even againſt all Law, Reaſon, and Equity) to declare it Criminal for any one to lend Money to his King.</p>
               <p>It is an antient Tradition, which has every where obtained Reputation, that <hi>Noah,</hi> as Lord of all, was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Diſtribution of the World, and of private Dominion, and that by the appointment of GOD himſelf he confirmed this Diſtribution by his laſt Will and Teſtament, left at his Death in the Hands of his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son <hi>Shem,</hi> by which he warned all his Sons, that none of them ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade any of their Brothers Dominions, becauſe Diſcord and Civil War, would thence neceſſarily follow.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95482:43"/>
               <p>Thus we find, that in all Nations the Princes were at firſt Lords of the whole Lands, as well as of the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, amongſt whom they divided ſuch part thereof, to be held by ſuch Tenures and Services, as they judged moſt convenient. Inſtead then of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires being founded in Property (as ſome men love to ſpeak) the Natural dominion of the Prince was the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of all Propriety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monarchs</hi> at firſt governed by no ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Rule or Law, but by immediate Edicts or commands of their own Wills, as they in their own Judgments thought fit. But when Kings came to be ſo buſied with Wars, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with publick Cares, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons could not have acceſs to them, to learn their Pleaſure upon every occaſion, then did they both for the Eaſe of themſelves, and their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſet down Laws, by which they would ordinarily govern, reſerving to themſelves nevertheleſs Liberty to vary from them, as oft as they in their Diſcretion ſhould think fit. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Princes graciouſly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to call to their Councels ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Chief men of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95482:43"/> and in time to admit likewiſe of Deputies from their People, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe Advice and Conſent they would neither make new, nor abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate old Laws. Thus all thoſe Rights and Priviledges, which licentious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make their pretence of conteſting with their Soveraigns, had no other Original but the Gracious Conceſſions of Princes, which tho they are ſo far bound to keep, as that, when in a ſetled Kingdom the Prince leaves to govern according to Law, he is guilty of very great Injuſtice; yet where he ſees the Laws rigorous or doubtful, he may (to the Peoples great Happineſs, leſt otherwiſe <hi>Summum jus</hi> ſhould prove <hi>Summa injuria</hi>) mitigate and interpret them. And whenever any powerful Faction ſhall, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ill uſe of the Grace and Bounty of the Prince, endanger the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Government, the Safety of the People, whom GOD has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Care, being the Law-paramount over all others, obliges him to make uſe of that Arbitrary Power; whereof (tho in the exerciſe of it he may reſtrain himſelf, yet) he can never be diveſted, to ſecure
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95482:44"/> himſelf and people from the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of malicious and ill-deſigning Perſons.</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore, that argue for Limited or Mixed <hi>Monarchies,</hi> do in effect only plead for Anarchy and Confuſion. For either theſe Limits muſt be ſuch Laws and Bounds, as the <hi>Monarch</hi> has ſet himſelf to Govern by, to the Obſervance whereof tho he may by Promiſe ſo far engage himſelf, that he cannot (as has been ſaid) ordinarily tranſgreſs them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sin of Injuſtice; yet this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his, which is but an After-act of Grace, not diſſolving that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Subjection, which preceded it, his Power (if he will ſinfully put it forth to act) is no leſs Arbitrary, than it was before the making of the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Or if you will imagin theſe Bounds of the <hi>Monarchs</hi> Power to be <hi>ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno,</hi> and not from the free Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his own Will, then (the Subject, as they ſay, not being legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to ſubjection, in caſe the Prince commands beyond the Law) if there ariſe a Diſpute between the <hi>Monarch</hi> and the meaneſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95482:44"/> about the Legality or Illegality of his Commands, either the <hi>Monarch</hi> himſelf muſt be Judge, and then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel Limitation; or elſe the whole people, or ſome part of them, and then farewel <hi>Monarchy;</hi> or elſe there muſt be no Judge at all, and then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe in that, which they call a mixed <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or a Government, compoſed of <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> either the Soveraign Power muſt be Originally in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> and derivatively only in the others, and then farewel the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or elſe it muſt (tho acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be an indiviſible Beam of Divine Perfection) be originally ſhared amongſt them all, and then farewel the <hi>Monarchy.</hi> So alſo in this Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as they call it) of Power, if a Difference ariſe between the Prince and the States, there being (according to their Principles) no Authoritative judge to determin it, the Government is diſſolved, and every man left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſide with that Part, which in his Reaſon and Judgment ſtands moſt for publick Good, more than which the Wit of Man cannot ſay for <hi>Anarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:95482:45"/>
               <p>The unlimited Juriſdiction of Kings is ſo ſtrongly aſſerted in Scripture, that it occaſioned one, who writ in juſtification of the late Rebellion, to affirm, <hi>That to make a King by the Standard of GOD's Word, is to make the Subjects Slaves for Conſcience ſake.</hi> Than which, I know not, whether any thing can be ſaid more impious.</p>
               <p>The Paternal Empire, as it was in it ſelf <hi>hereditary,</hi> ſo was it, as other Goods are, <hi>alienable</hi> by Patent, and <hi>ſeizable</hi> by an Uſurper. Thus amongſt the firſt Fathers of Families, diſperſed by the Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> was <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> who, being (no doubt) by good Right Lord or King over his own Family, and not contented therewith did againſt Right enlarge his Empire by violently ſeizing on the Rights of other Fathers of Families, and laid the Foundation of the firſt of thoſe great Kingdoms, which for the vaſt Extent of their Dominions were called the four <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the World. Yet this Power he got by Uſurpation, and not by any Election of, or Faction with the People or Multitude.</p>
               <p>The Dominions indeed of Princes anciently were but ſmall, conſiſting
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95482:45"/> generally but of Cities apiece, with the adjacent Teritories. Thus in a little Corner of <hi>Aſia</hi> nine Kings met at once in Battle: In the ſmall Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Land of <hi>Canaan Joſhuah</hi> deſtroyed one and thirty Kings: <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibezek</hi> made ſeventy Kings, whoſe Thumbs and Toes he had cut off, to feed under his Table: Two and thirty Kings came to <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria:</hi> and ſeventy Kings of <hi>Greece</hi> went to the Wars of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in proceſs of Time, partly by Conqueſt, partly by Lineal Succeſſion, and partly by the Ceſſion of many lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Princes, theſe Petty Kingdoms were united, and greater Monarchies erected. Whence, tho Kings are not now the Natural Parents of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet they all either are, or are to be reputed, the next Heirs to thoſe Progenitors, who were at firſt the Natural Parents of the whole people, and, as ſuch, ſucceed to the Exerciſe of Soveraign Juriſdiction, not only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their own Children, but over their Brethren, and all that were ſubject to their Fathers.</p>
               <p>As long as the firſt Fathers lived, they were properly called <hi>Patriarchs;</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:95482:46"/> but when the Fatherhood it ſelf was extinct, and the Right only deſcended to the next Heir, they were more ſignificantly ſtyled Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>If through Negligence the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true Heir to any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be loſt (for the Right it ſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can) yet does not the Supremacy devolve to the multitude, who never yet had right to Rule, or chooſe their Rulers; but to the Princes and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Heads of Families, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Dependency of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies is frequently obſcure, and worn out of Knowledge) to ſuch perſons, as the Wiſdom of the precedent <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> thought fit to adopt for Heads of Families, and Princes of Provinces Theſe, and none but theſe, have it ſuch Caſe alone Power to conſent in uniting or conferring their Fatherly Right of Soveraign Authority, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> whom they pleaſe. Nor does the perſon, thus elected, hold his Power as a Donative from the People, but from GOD, from whom alone he receives his Royal Charter of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Father, tho teſtified by the Miniſtry of the Heads of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:95482:46"/>
               <p>And altho I do not ſay, that all popular Governments are ſo far unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to oblige them (things being, as they are) to ſubject themſelves to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi> yet this I muſt aver, as a moſt undoubted Truth, that no other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but <hi>Monarchy,</hi> had ever any lawful Original, there never hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been any Nation, which was not for many years governed by Kings, untill Wantonneſs, Ambition, or Faction of the People made them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt new wayes of Regiment: which Mutations alwayes proved bloody, and miſerable to their Authors, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in nothing, but the ſhort time of their Duration.</p>
               <p>The Excellency of <hi>Monarchy</hi> is not only manifeſt by the Divineneſs of its Originall,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</note> but alſo by the ſingular Advantages, it has over any other Form of Government.</p>
               <p>The chief End of Government is, that the People may (according to the Apoſtle) <hi>Lead a quiet and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> Conſequently whereunto we find, that in all <hi>Monarchies,</hi> both before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> under it, and ever
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95482:47"/> ſince, whether <hi>Grecian,</hi> or <hi>Barbarian, Jewiſh,</hi> or <hi>Pagan, Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> a ſingular Care has been taken for Religion, the Prieſts whereof have been alwayes had in ſuch Reſpect and Veneration, as to have an eminent Share in the Adminiſtration of the Government. But in all popular States, their main Devotion being exerciſed only in oppoſing and ſuppreſſing <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> their next is to exclude the Clergy from medling with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> (of which it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that the one hath all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and the other none) do at this day agree.</p>
               <p>As for Peace, it is well known, that no people ever enjoyed it without <hi>Monarchy.</hi> The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves by warring, and when they had gotten the Empire, were preſently undone: for they could not live at reſt, knowing no better Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe than that of War: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the main Preſervatives of Peace are the Durability and Order of the Government, if we examine the moſt flouriſhing <hi>Democracy,</hi> that ever was in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:95482:47"/> we ſhall find, that the Duration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the expulſion of <hi>Tarquin</hi> to <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was but four hundred and eighty years, whereas both the <hi>Aſſyrian Monarchy</hi> laſted without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption at leaſt twelve hundred, and the Empire of the Eaſt fourteen hundred ninety five.</p>
               <p>And from Order they were ſo far, that, during theſe four hundred and eighty years, there was not any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Form of Government in <hi>Rome:</hi> for having once loſt the Natural Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Kings, they could not find whereon to reſt. They firſt choſe out of the Senators annual Conſuls, who had, during the ſhort Time of their Government, full Regal Power: About ſixteen years after the firſt Creation of Conſuls, the Commons by Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevailed, and choſe among themſelves Tribunes of the People to preſerve their Liberty: About fourty years after they left Tribunes and Conſuls, and choſe ten Men to make them Laws: Theſe after three years they diſplaced, and ſet up Tribunes and Conſuls again: Not long after they demanded, that one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls might be choſen out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95482:48"/> which after a Diſpute of threeſcore and eighteen years they carried by the ſtubbornneſs of the Tribunes, who, for five years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindring the Election of the greater Magiſtrates, forced the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to yeild to their Requeſt, leſt an Anarchy ſhould deſtroy them all: Sometimes they choſe Dictators, who were Temporary Kings, ſometimes Military Tribunes with Conſulary Power: One while the Senate made Laws, another while the People: In fine ſuch and ſo frequent were their Alterations in Government, that the beſt Hiſtorians are not able to find any perfect Form of Regiment in ſo much Confuſion. And if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Rome</hi> may be ſaid to have been for ſome time popular; yet it was ſo to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> alone, all the reſt of the Dominions being ſhared into Provinces, over which their Proconſuls, Propraetors, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates exerciſed Regal Authority: ſo impoſſible it is to govern a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, much more many Kingdoms by the whole or greateſt part of the People.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:95482:48"/>
               <p>And tho <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of her Popularity bred many admired Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders (ſeveral of which were but very ill requited by the People) by whoſe Conduct ſhe gained ſuch Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries abroad, as amazed the World; yet even then did the Tragical Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of her Citizens at home deſerve Commiſeration from her vanquiſhed Enemies. Nor were all of them able to ſupport her in times of danger; but in her greateſt Troubles ſhe was forced to create a Dictator, whoſe Authority was abſolute and unappeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, teſtifying thereby, that the laſt Refuge in Perils of State is to have recourſe to Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>And whatever may be pretended to be the Inconveniences of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> yet cannot it be denied, but that they are all outweighed by the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which neceſſarily attends Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity: There not having been a quarter of the Blood ſhed in <hi>Rome</hi> by the Cruelty of all her Tyrannical Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, as was by Seditions in the laſt hundred years of her glorious Common-wealth, when the Blood was ſuckt up in the Market-places with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95482:49"/> Spunges, the Current of the River <hi>Tyber</hi> ſtopt with the ſlaughtered Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Citizens, and the Common Privies ſtuffed full of them. For the Cruelty of Tyrants rarely extends any farther, than to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, that offend them: ſo that a King can never be ſo notoriouſly vitious, but he will generally favour Juſtice, and maintain Order, except in the particulars, where he is ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his inordinate Paſſion. For the Multitude of People, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Riches, whoſe Bodies do him ſervice in War, and whoſe Goods ſupply his preſent Wants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Strength and Glory of every Prince, Natural Love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if not Affection to his People will make him deſirous to preſerve the Lives, and protect the Goods of his Subjects, which, as it cannot be done without Juſtice, ſo if it be not done, the Princes Loſs is thereby the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. But in a popular State, every man knowing, that the Publick Good does not depend wholly upon his Care, they all mind chiefly their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Benefit, none taking the Publick to be his own Buſineſs: whence it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95482:49"/> follows, that <hi>every man</hi> (as it is ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had no King) <hi>does that, which is right in his own Eyes.</hi> And this is the Original of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural State of War, which ſome are pleaſed to miſcal the Natural Liberty of Mankind, where every man pretending a Right to every thing, there is none, that can have the leaſt Security of any thing, he enjoyes, nor yet of his very Life: ſince he may be deprived thereof by any one, that ſhall prove ſtronger than hinſelf.</p>
               <p>The Iſland of <hi>Great Britain</hi> has alwayes had that happineſs,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Britain</hi> alwayes Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Monarchs.</hi>
                  </note> as never to be ſubject to any other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the <hi>Monarchical.</hi> Not that the whole Iſland was always under the Command of one <hi>Monarch,</hi> (which as ſome ſay) it never was till ſince the Uniting of the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by King <hi>James,</hi> there being at <hi>Caeſars</hi> Arrival here no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than four Kings found in <hi>Kent</hi> alone. But that theſe were ſo many Soveraign Princes, reigning abſolutely over their own ſmall Dominions, who, at the Invaſion of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:95482:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> joyned together in a Confederacy for their mutual Defence, of which they made by common Conſent <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> their Head. The Words of <hi>Caeſar</hi> are <hi>Summa imperii bellique adminiſtrandi communi conſilio permiſſa eſt</hi> Caſſivellau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no: from whence ſome would infer, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had no King in time of Peace, but that <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> was by Conſent of a great Common Councel choſen King and General againſt his Landing: Contracting herein <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, who not only affirms, that there were four Kings within the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> whoſe Names he likewiſe gives us; but alſo deſcribes <hi>Caſſibelans</hi> Territory to have been bounded by the River <hi>Thames,</hi> which divided it from the Maritime Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to have extended eighty Miles from the Sea, telling us withal, that, whereas before his Arrival <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> was in continual Wars with the Neighbouring States, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in this common danger of forreign Invaſion, united in a defenſive League, and unanimouſly choſe him for their Leader.</p>
               <p>Nor was <hi>Britain</hi> brought under the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> till that, the

               <p>And altho the Invaſions of Forreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the ill Conduct of our Kings, the Ambition of the Princes of the Blood, the Faction of the Nobility, and the Sedition of the Vulgar have ſometimes cauſed Diſturbance in the State; yet never was there any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to aboliſh <hi>Monarchical</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Iſland, till ſuch time as, a certain hot-headed <hi>Frenchman,</hi> having invented a new fangled Eccleſiaſtical Government, agreeing (ſaid King <hi>James</hi>) with Monarchy, as GOD with the Devil, which by animating the People to Rebellion againſt, and Expulſion of their Lawful Prince, he introduced into <hi>Geneva,</hi> his Fanatical Diſciples here in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring to eſtabliſh their <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Diſcipline, and combining with certain Gentlemen, who by reading the Books of ſuch ancient Hiſtorians, as, living under Popular States, decried Regal Authority by the Name of Tyranny, and extolled

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95482:52"/> and with them his Confident <hi>Comius,</hi> on whom he had beſtowed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Arras</hi> to ſignifie to them his Intentions of coming ſpeedily over in perſon, giving him private Inſtructions to manage his Intereſt ſecretly with the Princes and States of <hi>Britain,</hi> and to gain a <hi>Roman</hi> Party in the Iſland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gaeſar</hi> in the mean time, having ſent <hi>Caius Voluſenus</hi> to ſpy out the Coaſts, drew down his Forces into the Countrey of the <hi>Morini</hi> about <hi>Bulloign,</hi> from whence was the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Paſſage into <hi>Britain.</hi> Here he commands a general Rendezvouz of all his Naval Forces, ſummoning from all parts his Shipping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voluſenus</hi> after five dayes Sail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned with ſuch ſmall Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as, not daring to land for fear of the <hi>Britains,</hi> he had been able to make from abord his Ship, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who had with him two Legions, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily amounting to five and twenty thouſand Foot, and four thouſand five hundred Horſe of <hi>Romans</hi> and their Allies, having embarkt the Foot in eighty Ships of Burthen, beſides the Gallies diſtributed amongſt the Commanders, and commanding the

               <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> who watched his Motions, ſending their Horſe and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots before, their Infantry ſpeeding after, undauntedly aſſaulted the <hi>Romans</hi> under their very Ships, and gave them ſo ſmart a Welcome, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, tho endeavoring by all means to excuſe it, could not yet deny, but that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95482:53"/> the reſolute Oppoſition of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> made his Souldiers forget their wonted Valour.</p>
               <p>By the help nevertheleſs of his Gallies, which, as more apt for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he commanded to row up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the open ſide of the Enemy, the unuſual ſtrangeneſs whereof, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Ratling of their Oars, and the fierce Battery of the Engines ſet up in them, made the amazed <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> ſtand a little at a Bay; and by the great Courage of the Standard-bearer of the tenth Legion, who, ſeeing, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> fearing the Depth of the Sea, or (more probably) the Readvancement of the Enemy, durſt not quit their Ships, having firſt invocated the Gods, leapt over board and with his Eagle advanced, marched boldly againſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> the Foot were with much difficulty diſembarkt, and the wearied Iſlanders after a ſharp diſpute forced to retire, whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> for want of his Horſe, that were yet kept back by the wind, was not able to purſue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> finding themſelves over-maſtered, had now made their Peace, ſent in ſome Hoſtages, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95482:53"/> promiſed more, and ſeveral of their Princes had ſubmitted themſelves and States to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> lying encamped, as 'tis thought, upon <hi>Barham-Down,</hi> when an unlookt-for Accident put them uppon new Counſels. For the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Ships, which had been left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to tranſport the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, being four dayes after <hi>Caeſars</hi> Arrival come within ſight of the Camp, were by a ſudden Tempeſt diſperſed, and that Night moſt of them loſt: Their Gallies alſo, which had been haled aſhore, being the ſame Night cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a Spring-tide, and their Ships, that lay off at Anchor, ſorely ſhattered.</p>
               <p>This the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princes perceiving, and from the Compaſs of their Camp, which without Baggage was the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, gueſſing at the Number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, conſulted together, and, ſecretly one by one withdrawing from the Camp, reſolved to ſtop all Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to protract the Buſineſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Winter: judging, that if they could now deſtroy their Enemies, or intercept their Return, none would ever after dare to invade them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> from his own Condition, and the <hi>Britains</hi> neglecting to ſend their

               <p>While this was doing, <hi>Caeſar</hi> adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the Sentinels at the Camp-Gates, that an unuſual Duſt was ſeen to ariſe from that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whither the ſeventh Legion was gone forth to forrage, taking with him the Cohorts of his Guards, and commanding all the reſt, but two, who were to keep the Camp, to ſpeed after him, came very opportunely, to aſſiſt his Legion, that was now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-born by the <hi>Britains,</hi> who, not doubting but their Enemies would on the morrow return to that Place, which they had only left unreapt of all their Harveſt, had laid themſelves in Ambuſh, and, whilſt the <hi>Romans</hi> were diſperſt, and buſy at their Labor, ſet upon them, killed ſome, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the reſt, and had now encloſed them with their Horſe and Chariots,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95482:54"/> when <hi>Caeſars</hi> Arrival cauſed the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> to retire, and he, not thinking it convenient to offer them Battel, drew off his Legions to the Camp.</p>
               <p>Foul weather for many dayes after hindring all Action on both ſides, the <hi>Britains</hi> by diſpatching Meſſengers into all parts, ſignifying to what ſmall number their Enemies were reduced, the great Hopes, there was of Spoil, and of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Country from future Invaſion, if they could now make the <hi>Romans</hi> a ſevere Example, had got together great Multitudes both of Horſe and Foot, whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> having after a fierce Encounter put to flight, purſued, as far as he could, and in his return burnt and laid waſt all about him.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Britain,</hi> which was wel-nigh loſt, being thus by one Battel recovered, the vindicative Nature of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> who, tho otherwiſe a very worthy perſon, over-proud of his Victory, gave too much way to his Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>In this poſture Affairs continued here, till that <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion of the Empire, ſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Petilius Crealis,</hi> who had many Battels with the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> over whom tho he obtained ſome Victories, yet he had alwayes enough of War. His Succeſſor <hi>Julius Frontinus</hi> ſubdued the ſtout and warlike Nation of the <hi>Silu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi> But <hi>Julius Agricola,</hi> ſent into <hi>Britain</hi> in the laſt year of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> extended the <hi>Roman</hi> Limits beyond all his Predeceſſors: For at his very entrance into this Government he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew, and almoſt extirpated the whole Nation of the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95482:65"/> gained the Iſle of <hi>Mona,</hi> from the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion whereof the Rebellion of the <hi>Britains</hi> had called back <hi>Suetonius.</hi> After which by proportionating with Equality the impoſed Tribute, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Exactions and exorbitant Fees of Officers, and bridling the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance and Licentiouſneſs of his Domeſticks and Souldiers, he brought the People to be in love with Peace, which before ſeemed no leſs formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, than War it ſelf: So that having firſt by many Inrodes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the Enemy, and then by his gentle Demeanor allured them, ſeveral Cities, which hitherto had refuſed to bend, voluntarily ſubmitted to him, gave Hoſtages, and received Gariſons, for which he providently choſe Places of ſuch advantage, that never any of them was either forced, yielded up, or quitted. Then encouraging the <hi>Britains,</hi> who before lived rude and ſcattered, to build Houſes, Temples, and Places for Publick Reſort, he taught them the Inſtitutes and Cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms of a Civil Life, cauſing their Noblemens Sons to be inſtructed in the Liberal Sciences, and by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Wits of <hi>Britain</hi> before thoſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95482:65"/> of <hi>Gallia,</hi> bringing them, who before hated the <hi>Roman</hi> Language, to be in love with the <hi>Latin</hi> Eloquence. Now likewiſe came in the Gown, and other Faſhions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees all thoſe Incitements of Vice, and Voluptuous Living, which the Luxurious miſcall Civility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glota</hi> and <hi>Bodotria</hi> (called at this day <hi>Dunbritton</hi> and <hi>Edinborough</hi> Friths) two oppoſite Arms of the Sea, disjoined only by a Neck of Land, with all the Creeks and Inlets on this Side, being now held by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Enemy ſhut up (as it were) in another Iſland, <hi>Agricola</hi> paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into, and ſubdued Nations, till then unknown, ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and other <hi>Scotch</hi> Iſles, and placed Garriſons likewiſe in that part of <hi>Britain,</hi> which faced <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the Conqueſt whereof he alſo aimed, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly entertaining for that purpoſe one of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Kings, driven out of his Country by Civil Wars, whom he kept with him for a fit Occaſion.</p>
               <p>But an Apprehenſion of a general Riſing of the Nations beyond <hi>Bodotria</hi> called him away from this deſign: for underſtanding, that they had
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95482:66"/> forelaid the Paſſages by land, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Fleet to bear along the Shores, and up the Friths and Harbors, himſelf with even Marches keeping up cloſe to it, ſo that both Land and Sea Forces joined commonly at night with Shouts and loud Greetings: Which much daunted the <hi>Britains,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſee their Sea ſo ridden.</p>
               <p>Yet the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> generally taking Arms, and attacking ſundry Caſtles, ſtrook no ſmall Terror into ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders, who, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing their Fears under the Name of cautious Counſel, adviſed the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to retreat on this ſide <hi>Bodotria.</hi> But he, whoſe Reſolutions were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, having Intelligence, that the Enemy would fall on in many Bodies, divided alſo his Army into three parts: Which the <hi>Britains</hi> learning, changed Counſels, and with all their Forces aſſailed by night that part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, which they knew to be the weakeſt, whom ſurprizing between Sleep and Fear, they had now begun ſome Execution, when <hi>Agricola,</hi> who was informed of their March, following them at the Heels, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the lighteſt of his Horſe and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95482:66"/> Foot to charge on their Backs, the whole Army ſoon ſeconding them with a Shout: So that by approach of Day the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> finding themſelves encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt with the glittering <hi>Roman</hi> Enſigns, after a ſharp Fight betook themſelves to their old Refuge, the Woods and Boggs, or elſe that day had probably made a total End of the War. The <hi>Romans,</hi> reencouraged with this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and now boaſting, who but ere while trembled, with one voice cried out to be led on, as far as there was any <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ground. Nor did the <hi>Britains,</hi> who imputed that Dayes Victory not to the Valor of their Enemies, but to the Policy of their General, abate any thing of their Stoutneſs; but arming their Youth, and conveying their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to places of Safety, with ſolemn and ſacred vows bound themſelves to mutual aſſiſtance againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Adverſary.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a Cohort of <hi>

               <p>The Summer following <hi>Agricola,</hi> having gained this Knowledge, ſending forth his Navy to ſcour the Coaſts, and by various and uncertain Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to divert and diſunite the Enemy, with a flying Army, wherein were many <hi>Britains,</hi> whoſe Courage and Fidelity he had long experienced, came as far as the Mountain <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> where the <hi>Caledonians</hi> to the number of thirty thouſand were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled under the command of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacus,</hi> whom both his Birth and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit made their chief Leader.

               <p>
                  <hi>Agricola,</hi> informed hereof by his Scouts, Summer being far ſpent, and it being now no fit Time to divide his Forces, leads his Army amongſt the <hi>Horeſti,</hi> thought to be the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Eskdale</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whom having received Hoſtages, he commanded his Navy to ſail round <hi>Britain,</hi> whilſt himſelf with ſlow Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that he might aw the new-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Nations by his Delay in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, placed his Men in their Winter Quarters.

               <p>BRITAIN, not being annexed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire till after the Diviſion of Provinces made by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> had this Priviledge above other Nations, that it was never ſubject to any Conſular or Proconſular Deputy after the manner of other Provinces; but was alwayes eſteemed to be <hi>Praeſidialis,</hi> or under the immediate Protection of the Emperor, held by his Garriſons, and governed by Lieutenants, ſent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called at his ſole Will and Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> had alſo (even within the <hi>Roman</hi> Pale) for a time Kings of their own, the laſt of which was <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Lever-maur,</hi> who flouriſhed in the time of the Emperour <hi>Commodus Antoninus.</hi> This, tho it carried with it a certain ſhew of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, was yet only the uſual Method of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, firſt practiced in the Time of their Democratick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when their Inſolence was ſuch, as to make Kings the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95482:69"/> of their Ambition, whom they firſt drew up with Plumes of Majeſty, and ſeemed even to adore; but, when their Turns were once ſerved, with as great Contempt and Ingratitude (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtant Humor of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths) they trampled upon them.</p>
               <p>For the governing of <hi>Britain</hi> one Legat was thought ſufficient, till the Emperor <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> finding by experience, that it was a Province too great and powerful to be truſted in the hands of one Man, firſt divided it into two Governments, committing the North part thereof to <hi>Virius Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> and the South to <hi>Heraclytus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Time of <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> there were no more Propraetors or Lieutenants in <hi>Britain:</hi> For he, having ordained four Prefects of the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> viz. of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> of <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and two Leaders or Commanders of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the one of the Foot, the other of the Horſe, in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> whom they termed <hi>Praeſentales,</hi> ordered the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Britain</hi> in this manner.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95482:78"/> was now made a Scene of Blood, and the very firſt Theatre, whereon theſe bloody Emperours began to Act thoſe Tragedies, whereat Mankind ſtood amazed.</p>
               <p>The firſt, that ſuffered under their cruel Edicts, was our glorious Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyr St. <hi>Albanus,</hi> who, being an Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of <hi>Verulam,</hi> deſcended of an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Roman</hi> Family, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Procurator in <hi>Britain,</hi> courteouſly (tho himſelf yet a <hi>Pagan</hi>) entertained a certain reverend <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prieſt, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> then newly come from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> by whom being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the true Faith, he lent him at his departure his own Military Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock, woven with Gold, that he might the better eſcape: for which being accuſed before the Judge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for that purpoſe, and owning himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he was after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Torments beheaded, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners Eyes falling to the Ground with the Martyrs Head. To his Honour after the ceaſing of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution were ſeveral Churches erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one particularly in the Place, where by ſhedding his Blood he had triumphed: Which St: <hi>Germanus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95482:79"/> of <hi>Auxerre</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> viſiting, that he might here pay his thanks to GOD, for his Victory over the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſy, took from the Place, where the Martyrs Blood had been ſhed, a Lump of Earth, which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him into <hi>France.</hi> This no doubt occaſioned the Miſtake of thoſe, who affirmed the Body of St. <hi>Alban</hi> to have been carried hence into <hi>France</hi> by St. <hi>Germanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken among the <hi>Cornabii,</hi> where a great Multitude of People were, as they attended to his Preaching, ſlain by the <hi>Pagans,</hi> was brought to <hi>Rudburn,</hi> a Village three Miles from <hi>Verulam,</hi> where his Belly being ript open, and his Guts faſtned to a Stake, ſet in the Ground, he was by cruel whipping forced to walk about it, enwrapping it with his Bowels, his Body like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe being torn with Knives and Lances, till at laſt he yielded up his Soul to GOD: After which his Body was by a certain <hi>Chriſtian</hi> privately taken away, and buried.</p>
               <p>Many more were here likewiſe Crowned with Martyrdom, two of the moſt remarkable whereof were
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95482:79"/> St. <hi>Aaron</hi> and St. <hi>Julius,</hi> conſiderable Citizens of <hi>Caer-Leon</hi> upon <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe, who ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, many perſecuted <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which were left, hid themſelves in Woods, Deſarts, and Caves of Rocks, expecting from GOD, the juſt Judge of all, when he would pleaſe to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Judgments on their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and reſtore Safety and Liberty to their own Souls.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britiſh Chriſtians</hi> thus abſcond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Rage of their Enemies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it ſelf upon their Churches, all which by this Tempeſt were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther utterly deſtroyed, or turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to places for the Idolatrous Worſhip of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as that of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was into a Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſo that in ſeveral Provinces of this Iſland there remained no Marks at all of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>Tho the <hi>Britains</hi> for about nine years groaned under this Perſecution, yet it was ſooner mitigated here, than in any other part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.

               <p>In the Year of our Lord 311. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> being dead, there remained in the Empire four Perſons, by whom the reſpective Provinces were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely and independently admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> by <hi>Conſtantin; Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> by <hi>Maxentius;</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> by <hi>Maximinus; Pannonia, Greece, Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> and <hi>Thrace</hi> by <hi>Licinius.</hi> Whereof <hi>Maxentius,</hi> under whoſe Tyranny all <hi>Italy</hi> (eſpecially <hi>Rome</hi>) groaned, refuſing Conditions of Peace, offered him by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin,</hi> whom he would not admit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fellowſhip in the Empire, <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> concluding a War againſt him to be both juſt and neceſſary, and ſenſible, that his Adverſary was ſuperior to him in ſtrength, had recourſe to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, and uncertain amongſt ſuch a Multitude of Gods, to which he ſhould addreſs himſelf, calling to mind, how former Emperors had to their own Ruine been abuſed by the deceitful Oracles of their falſe Gods, reſolved to put his Truſt in the only true GOD, worſhipped by his Mother <hi>Helena</hi> all her Life-time, and by his Father <hi>Conſtantius</hi> towards

               <p>The Day appearing, the Emperor, having declared this Viſion to his Friends, called together the moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Jewellers, that could be found, to whom having deſcribed the Pattern of the Sign, which he had ſeen, he

               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:95482:83"/>
               <p>Now began <hi>Conſtantin</hi> to publiſh Laws for the advantage of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> ordaining, that Clergymen ſhould be excuſed from all manner of Civil Offices and Duties, to the end they might not by the envious Malice of any be withdrawn from the Service of GOD.

               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:95482:86"/>
               <p>For this high Dignity there were two conſiderable Competitors: <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Ambroſius,</hi> deſcended of a noble <hi>Roman</hi> Family, and (as it is ſuppoſed) Son of <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> who in the dayes of <hi>Honorius</hi> pretended to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and <hi>Vortigern,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Damnonii,</hi> or, as ſome write, Conſul of the <hi>Geviſſei,</hi> Inhabitants of the South-Weſtern parts about <hi>Cornwal</hi> or <hi>South-Wales:</hi> Which Principality, it ſeems, he had governed well enough to be eſteemed not unworthy to be preferred above his formerly Fellow-Princes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambroſius</hi> therefore, with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter Pendragon,</hi> retiring into leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> quitted both his Pretence and Country to <hi>Vortigern,</hi> who, the Choice thus falling on him, was in the Year 438 anointed King: For, that in thoſe ancient times of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government the ſolemn Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of anointing their Kings was in uſe in this Iſland, is clear from the Teſtimony of <hi>Gildas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vortigern,</hi> thus advanced to the Throne, governed a while his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality with Moderation. In the eighth year of his Reign the <hi>Picts,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But in vain were theſe Supplications, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who could ſcarce ſecure the heart of their Empire, infeſted with the <hi>Huns</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to afford them any aſſiſtance. Many therefore of the <hi>Britains,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves thus rejected, wearied
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95482:87"/> with flying from place to place, and ſpent with the terrible Famin, which had long afflicted them, yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Slaves to their Savage Enemies; but others, more reſolute, taught by their Miſeries to ſeek aid from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, retired to inacceſſible Mountains and Caves, whence with Courage and Succeſs they often aſſaulted theſe rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Spoilers, recovering from them their Booty, and driving them back to their own Quarters.</p>
               <p>Theſe hoſtil Invaſions therefore a while ceaſing, the <hi>Britains</hi> ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to cultivate their Ground, which with ſcarce credible Plenty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly recompenced their Labors.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were their Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and their pinching Hunger allaid, but their Piety likewiſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, in the room whereof ſucceeded exceſſive Luxury, accompanied with all ſorts of Vices, infecting not the Laity only, but the Clergy alſo, who ought to have been Guides to others. And altho GOD ſought to reclaim them by his Scourge of Peſtilence, by which ſuch Multitudes periſhed, that the Living were not ſufficient to bury the Dead; yet were they with this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95482:88"/> Severity nothing at all amended, but like <hi>Solomons</hi> Fool, tho ſcourged, yet they felt it not.</p>
               <p>GODs Patience therefore being ſpent towards a People, which grew worſe both by Proſperity and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, he ſo far infatuated their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that they themſelves invited from a remote Country Enemies, far more ſavage and barbarous than either the <hi>Picts</hi> or <hi>Scots.</hi>

               <p>The Northern Spoilers, whom fear of the Contagion had kept within their own Borders, the Infection now beginning to ceaſe, readvanced into the Inland Countrey, againſt whoſe Incurſions the better to provide, King <hi>Vortigern</hi> ſummoned a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, where by common Advice it was reſolved, that Ambaſſadors ſhould be ſent into <hi>Germany</hi> to hire the <hi>Saxons</hi> to their aſſiſtance: an Army of which in the year 449 landing in <hi>Britain</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and <hi>Horſa,</hi> the <hi>Britains,</hi> by their Help overcoming their Enemies, who were come as far as <hi>Stamford</hi> in <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> gave them great Poſſeſions in that part of the ſame County, now called <hi>Lindſey,</hi> where they built <hi>Thong-Caſtle.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the preſent Government of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> in general.</head>
               <p>OF <hi>Monarchies</hi> ſome are <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> the Crown deſcending ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only to the Heirs Male, as has long been practiced in <hi>France;</hi> or to the next of Blood without Diſtinction of Sex, as in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Others are <hi>Elective,</hi> where, upon the Death of every Prince, another is choſen to ſucceed, without any reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Heirs of the Predeceſſor, as is uſed in <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of <hi>Hereditary Monarchies</hi> ſome are dependent, holden of earthly Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, to whom the Princes are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do Homage for the ſame, as is the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> holden at this day of the Pope by the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Others are independent, whoſe Princes acknowledge no Superior upon Earth, but hold only of GOD and by their Sword.</p>
               <p>Of this latter ſort is the Empire of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> being an <hi>Hereditary Monarchy,</hi> conſiſting of two Provinces
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95482:99" rendition="simple:additions"/> or Kingdoms, governed by one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, Abſolute, Independent, Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſable, and Unaccountable Head, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the known Laws and Cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms of each Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>Free Monarchy,</hi> challenging, above many other <hi>Europaean</hi> Kingdoms, an Exemption from all Subjection to the Emperor, or Laws of the Empi- to which as the <hi>Northern</hi> Part of the Iſland, or Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> was never ſubject; ſo the <hi>Southern</hi> part, ſince called the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> being abandoned by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who had by force obtained the Dominion thereof, the Right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by all manner of Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the ancient Inhabitants, to the laſt of whoſe Kings, <hi>viz. Cadwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladar</hi> our preſent Sovereign is (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the precedent Genealogy) by Lineal and Legitimate Deſcent the true and unqueſtionable Heir.</p>
               <p>And as it is exempt from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Juriſdiction and Dominion, ſo likewiſe is it free from all <hi>Interregnum,</hi> and many other Domeſtick Miſchiefs, whereunto <hi>Elective</hi> Kingdoms are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſubject.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:95482:100"/>
               <p>It is a Monarchy, wherein the Grace and Bounty of its Princes, rendring the ſubordinate Concurrence of the three Eſtates neceſſary to the making and repealing of all Statutes or Acts of Parliament in either Realm, have afforded ſo much to the Induſtry, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Happineſs of the Subject, and made the Yoak of Government ſo eaſy, and its Burden ſo light, that, were it not for thoſe malevolent and <hi>Fanatical</hi> Spirits, which by ſowing Jealouſies amongſt the People, and raiſing Animoſities in their Minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Prince, endeavor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the benefit of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by rendring their Meetings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, our Condition might well be envied by all other Nations of the Univerſe.</p>

               <p>TO the Monarch of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is given in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which is the Language moſt generally ſpoken through his whole Dominions, the Name <hi>King,</hi> which hath its Original from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Word <hi>Koning,</hi> and intimateth that Power and Knowledge, wherewith every Soveraign ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially be inveſted.</p>

               <p>When the Kings and Princes of the World began to ſubmit their Crowns and Scepters to the Croſs of our Redeemer, and inſtead of Perſecutors to become Protectors of the Church, this ſacred Ceremony of Anointing was again reſtored, and Monarchs thereby admoniſhed, that, as their Perſons were ſacred and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, ſo it was no leſs a part of their
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95482:108"/> Duty to take care of the external Regulation and peace of the Church, than of the Civil Government of their States. Yet were there antiently none anointed, but the two Emperors of the Eaſt and Weſt, the Kings of <hi>France, England, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> amongſt whom the Monarch of <hi>Great Britain</hi> may lay as ancient a Claim to this Holy Unction, as any other Prince of <hi>Europe,</hi> the very firſt Kings of this Iſland, after it was freed from the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Romans,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been anointed.

               <p>Of this Sacred Perſon of the King, of his Life and Safety ſo ſingular a Care is taken, that the Laws of both the Realms, whereinto this Iſland is divided, do herein agree, that it is High Treaſon, only to imagin or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Death of the King: And becauſe likewiſe by imagining or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the Death of the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, or Great Officers of his Houſhold, the Death of the Sovereign may enſue, and is uſually aimed at,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95482:108"/> all ſuch Conſpiracies, tho never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king effect, are puniſhed with Death, tho in all other Capital Caſes no man is put to Death, unleſs the Act follow the Intent.</p>
               <p>Nay in ſo high an eſteem is the Kings Perſon had, that to offend againſt thoſe Perſons and Things, whereby he is repreſented, as to kill ſome of the Crown Officers, or any of the Kings Judges, executing their Office, to counterfeit the Kings Seals, or his Moneys, is made High Treaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by all theſe his Sacred Perſon is repreſented. And ſo horrid is this Crime of High Treaſon, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Loſs of Life and Honour, the Criminal forfeits all his Eſtate Real and Perſonal, his Wife loſes her Dower, his Children their Nobility, and all their Right of Inheritance to him or any other Anceſtor, and are to be ranked amongſt the Peaſantry and Ignoble, till the King ſhall pleaſe to reſtore them. For ſo heinous is this Offence, that the Law can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endure to ſee the Poſterity of the Offender ſurvive him.</p>
               <p>And rather than Treaſon againſt the Kings Perſon ſhall go unpuniſhed,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95482:109"/> the Innocent ſhall in ſome caſes ſuffer: for if an Ideot or Lunatick (who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Will, cannot poſſibly be ſaid to offend) ſhall, during his Ideocy, or Lunacy, kill or go about to kill the King, he ſhall be puniſhed as a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; tho not being <hi>Compos mentis,</hi> he can neither commit Felony, Petit Treaſon, or any other ſort of High Treaſon,</p>
               <p>So tender a Regard is moreover had of this moſt precious Perſon of the King, that no Phyſick ought to be adminiſtred to him, but what his Phyſicians prepare with their own Hands, and not by the Hands of any Apothecary; nor are they to uſe the Aſſiſtance of any Chirurgeons, but ſuch, as are ſworn Chirurgeons to his Perſon.</p>
               <p>This Perſon of the King in his Natural as well as Politick Capacity is every Subject to defend with his own Life and Limbs.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95482:111"/> mean time might happen great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to enſue to the Realm: And weighing alſo, that his Majeſty, which by the Kingly and Regal Power, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him by GOD, may do many things in ſuch Caſes, ſhould not be driven to extend the Liberties, and Supremity of his Regal Power, and Dignity, by wilfulneſs of froward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: It is therefore thought fit, that the King with the Advice of his Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Councel ſhould ſet forth Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations for the good of the People, and Defence of his Royal Dignity, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſhall require.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King only can give Patents in caſe of Loſſes by Fire, or otherwiſe, to receive the charitable Benevolences of the People, without which none may ask it publickly.</p>
               <p>The King by his Prerogative is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus Haeres Regni,</hi> and the Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of all Eſtates, when no Heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: For this cauſe all Eſtates for want of Heirs, or by Forfeiture, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat to the King. All Spiritual Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, for want of Preſentation by the Biſhop, are lapſed at laſt to the King. All Money, Gold, Silver, Plate or Bullion, found (and the Owners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95482:112"/> not known) belong to the King: and ſo do all Wayfs, Strays, Wrecks, not granted away by him, or any of his Predeceſſors.

               <p>In the Church the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is very great. He only hath the Patronage of all Biſhopricks: None can be elected Biſhop, but whom he hath firſt nominated; None can be conſecrated, or take poſſeſſion of the Revenues of any Biſhoprick without his ſpecial Writ or Aſſent. He is the Nurſing-Father of the Church, and hath Power to call a National or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod, and with the Advice and Conſent thereof to make Canons, Orders, Ordinances and Conſtitutions, relating to the Government and Polity of the Church, wherein (as it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Chriſtopher Wray,</hi> Speaker of the Houſe of Commons in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) the Princes Power is abſolute.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:95482:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The King has Power, upon Cauſes only known to himſelf, to diſpence by <hi>Non Obſtantes</hi> with General Laws, made in Parliament, and with the Penalties for tranſgreſſing them, where ſuch Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty is appropriated to himſelf alone; to mitigate the Rigor of the Laws, where Equity and Conſcience require Moderation, to alter or ſuſpend any particular Law, that he judges hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Commonwealth; to pardon a Man, legally condemned; to grant ſpecial Priviledges to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Colledges, and Corporations, and if any Doubt ariſes concerning ſuch Priviledges, he only has Right to interpret them. To him, and the Judges, conſtituted by him, does it belong to interpret all Statutes, and to determin, and paſs Sentence in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not defined by Law.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome Branches of that <hi>Jus Coronae,</hi> of that Regal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, of the name whereof however ſome perſons are afraid, yet may they aſſure themſelves, that the Caſe of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would be deſperately miſerable without it: ſince the Kings juſt Rights are the beſt Preſerver of the Peoples Liberties, being an impregnable Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95482:113"/> againſt all popular Invaſions and illegal Powers. Nor have there ever been found any greater Oppreſſors of the People, than thoſe, who under pretence of aſſerting their Liberties have endeavored to leſſen the Royal Authority. Thus in the great Conteſt between <hi>Henry</hi> the IIId. King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Barons, about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Liberties of themſelves and the People, the King being forced at length to yield, the Lords, inſtead of that glorious Freedom, which they promiſed the Nation, ingroſſed all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into their own Hands under the Name of the twenty four Conſervators of the Kingdom, behaving themſelves like ſo many Tyrants, acting all in their own Names, and in Juntoes of their own, wholly neglecting, or elſe over-ruling Parliaments. But then not agreeing among themſelves, four of them (<hi>viz.</hi> the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Hereford</hi> and <hi>Spencer</hi>) defeated the other twenty, and drew the entire Management of Affairs into their own hands: Yet it continued ſo not long, <hi>Leiceſter</hi> getting all into his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who being ſlain in Battle, the King recovered his Authority, and the People their true Liberty.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:95482:113"/>
               <p>Many of theſe Prerogatives, thoſe eſpecially, that concern Juſtice, and Peace, are ſo eſſential to Royalty, that they cannot be ſeparated from it, but by the deſtruction of the Monarchy it ſelf. Not without reaſon therefore did the Eſtates of <hi>England,</hi> aſſembled in Parliament in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the IIId. declare, that they could not (tho the King himſelf ſhould deſire it) aſſent to any thing, which tended to the Diſheriſon of the King and his Crown, whereunto they were ſworn. The King therefore, as he is by his Office <hi>Debitor Juſtitiae,</hi> oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adminiſter Juſtice to his People, ſo is he in Conſcience bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Rights of the Crown in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and to endeavour the recovery of thoſe, whereof it has been diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt. And how diſmal the Effects have been, whenever any King, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the religious obſervance of this part of his Duty, has been prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to give way to the leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Royal Prerogative, we have a ſad Example in his Majeſties Father of Bleſſed Memory, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (tho but only <hi>Pro illa vice</hi>) with his abſolute Power of diſſolving Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95482:114"/> and giving it to the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they never ceaſed farther incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Prerogatives, till he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was barbarouſly murthered, the Government wholly ſubverted, and all the Liberties of the People trampled under foot. To him therefore, that ſhall ſeriouſly conſider the many fatal Miſchiefs and Inconveniences, which neceſſarily follow the Diminution of the Kings Prerogative, it will ſeem no Paradox to affirm, that it is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects great Intereſt to be far more ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, that the King maintain and uphold his own Prerogative and Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, than their Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which, as they had no other Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal but the Grace and Bounty of the Prince, ſo muſt they of neceſſity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, when he is no longer able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them. It is not thefore to be wondred, that a right Apprehenſion of ſuch pernicious Conſequences made his Sacred Majeſty refuſe his Royal Aſſent to a Bill, preſented him for the raiſing of the <hi>Militia,</hi> tho it was (if paſſed into an Act) to have continued in force but ſix Weeks: Becauſe the Tendency of the Bill being to put out of his Poſſeſſion the <hi>Poſſe Regni,</hi> or
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95482:114"/> abſolute command over the Forces of the Realm, he could not anſwer unto GOD, by whom alone he is intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Regal Power for the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Well-Government of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the abandoning (tho for ſo ſhort a time) the Protection and Defence of the People, committed to his Charge.</p>
               <p>Whatever things are proper unto Supreme Majeſty, Scepters and Crowns,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</note> the Purple Robe, the Globe or Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Ball, and Holy Unction, have as long appertained to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, as to any other Prince in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> The Antiquity of anointing Kings in <hi>Britain</hi> has been already ſhewn out of <hi>Gildas;</hi> and as for the other four, they are by <hi>Leland,</hi> a famous Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, aſcribed unto King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who began his Reign in the Year of our Lord 506. Which was as ſoon, as they were ordinarily in uſe with the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and unaccountable Monarch, a Free Prince of Soveraign Power, not holding his Kingdom in Vaſſallage nor receiving his Inſtalment or Inveſtiture
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95482:115"/> from another; Nor does he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Superiority to any, but to GOD alone.</p>
               <p>He is not only the Supreme, but ſole Legiſlator within his Dominions. The Power of making Laws (whatever ſome Antimonarchiſts pretend to the contrary) reſts ſolely in him. And altho the Gracious Condeſcenſion of our Kings has been ſuch, as to render the ſubordinate Concurrence of the Eſtates of each Realm a Condition, requiſite to the making of new, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating of old Laws within the reſpective Kingdoms; yet are they not thereby admitted to any Share in the Soveraignty, their Power being wholly derivative from the King, who is <hi>Caput, Principium, &amp; Finis Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum,</hi> the three Eſtates, when aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Parliament, being as much his Subjects, as every particular Man of them is, when the Meeting is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. All Bills, paſſed by them, are but ſo much dead matter, till quickned by his Royal <hi>Fiat,</hi> which alone gives Life and Form to all their Proceedings. Nor is it <hi>ex debito Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> but of his Special Grace, that he paſſes ſuch Acts, as are preſented to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95482:115"/> him. Thus <hi>Henry</hi> the IIId. begins his <hi>Magna Charta</hi> with <hi>Know ye, that WE of our meer and free Will have given theſe Liberties.</hi> Thus we hear King <hi>Edward</hi> the Iſt. ſaying: <hi>The King of his ſpecial Grace for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the Grievances of His People ſuſtained by his Wars, and for the Amendment of their Eſtate, and to the intent that they may be the more ready to do him Service, the more willing to aſſiſt and aid him in time of need, Grants.</hi> 28. E. 1. c. 1. And altho of later times Laws are ſaid to be made by Authority of Parliament, yet if we look into our antient Statutes, we ſhall find the meaning to be, that <hi>The King Ordains, the Lords adviſe, and the Commons conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe then are much miſtaken, who affirm the Parliament to be (at the leaſt) as Eſſential a Part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as the Prince: Which if it were true, whenever the Parliament is diſſolved, the Government would be ſo too. But this with the Pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maxim of Coordinacy, or ſharing the Soveraign Power between King, Lords, and Commons, with other treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and Antimonarchical Doctrines,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95482:116"/> daily diſperſed amongſt the People, and with the utmoſt of his Art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly aſſerted by the Author of a late ſeditious Book, entituled <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> together with his audacious Propoſals, aiming to take all the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of the Imperial Diadem of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarch, are moſt fitly to be anſwered in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs to the ſubverſion of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (which being purely Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, may be without the two Houſes, whereas they cannot be without the King) than thoſe traitorous Deſigns, for which <hi>Coleman</hi> and his Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces paid their forfeited Lives to the Juſtice of the Laws.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is Lord Paramount, ſupreme Landlord of all the Lands within his Dominions, all landed men being mediately or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately his Tenants by ſome Tenure, or other. <hi>By the Laws and Ordinances of ancient Kings</hi> (ſaith Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in the firſt part of his Inſtitutes) <hi>and eſpecially of King</hi> Alfred <hi>it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the firſt Kings of this Realm had all the Lands of</hi> England <hi>in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne; and the great Manors and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties they reſerved to themſelves and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95482:116"/> of the Remnant they, for the Defence of the Realm, enfeoffed the Barons of the Realm with ſuch Juriſdiction, as the Court Baron now hath.</hi> The King (as it is evident by the Rolls of the Chancellery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which contain their eldeſt and fundamental Laws) is <hi>Dominus omnium bonorum,</hi> and <hi>Dominus directus totius Dominii,</hi> the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being but his Vaſſals, and from him holding all their Lands as their Over-lord. Thus none, but the King, hath <hi>Allodium</hi> and <hi>Directum Dominium,</hi> the ſole and independent Property in any Land. Upon this Ground no doubt it was that Serjeant <hi>Heal</hi> in the three and fortieth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaid in Parliament, <hi>He marvelled, the Houſe stood either at the granting of a Subſidy or time of Payment, when all we have, is her Majeſties, and She may lawfully at her pleaſure take it from us; and that She had as much Right to all our Lands and Goods, as to any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the Crown;</hi> And he ſaid, he could prove it by Precedents in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the IIId. King <hi>John</hi> and King <hi>Stephen.</hi> And upon the ſame Ground was it reſolved by the Judges in the beginning of the Reign of King
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95482:117"/> 
                  <hi>James,</hi> when there was a purpoſe to have taken away Tenures by Act of Parliament, That ſuch a Statute had been void, becauſe the Tenures were for the Defence of the King and Kingdom. And altho ſince that the Tenures, which gave a Dependency upon the Crown, and were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Safety to the King and People, have been taken away, and thereby a great Blow given to Monarchy; yet let thoſe, who have the Fee, the <hi>Jus perpetuum,</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile Dominium,</hi> have a care, leſt by following the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Advice of <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> and abuſing the Grace and Bounty of the Prince by endeavoring to draw the Soveraignty to themſelves, they neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate not their King, for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of himſelf and People, to have Recourſe to his Prerogative, which is a Preheminence, in Caſes of Neceſſity, above and before the Law of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Inheritance: For the Prevention whereof it is to be wiſhed, that either by an Act of Reſumption of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Demeſns of the Crown (which was a ſacred Patrimony, and by Law unalienable) or by ſuch other way, as the Wiſdom of the Nation ſhall think
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95482:117"/> fit, a Royal Support, adaequate to the Charges of the Crown, be made for the King to defend his Kingdom and protect his People: ſo that he may not be reduced to the Infelicity of having a precarious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue out of the Peoples Purſe, and to be beholden to a Parliament for his Bread in time of Peace, which is no good Condition for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
               <p>As the Legiſlative Power is ſolely in the King, ſo he alone has the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice and Execution of the Law. He is the Fountain of all Juſtice, which by his Judges, and other inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as ſo many Cryſtal Pipes, he conveyeth to his People. <hi>We will</hi> (ſaith <hi>Edward</hi> the Iſt. in his Book of Laws, written at his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by <hi>John Briton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford) that our own Juriſdiction be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Juriſdictions in our Realm, ſo that in all manner of Felonies, Treſpaſſes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and all other Actions Perſonal or Real, We have Power to render or cauſe to be rendred ſuch Judgments as do appertain without other Proceſs, whereever we know the right Truth, as Judges.

               <p>From the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who, being the only Supreme Head, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Plenary Power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to render Juſtice to every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber within his Dominions, there lies no Appeal in Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Authority ever ſince the Reformation has been here wholly abrogated; nor in Civil Matters to the Emperor, who for above twelve hundred years has not had the leaſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95482:118"/> Shadow of Pretence to any Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within this Iſland; nor in either to the people, who both in themſelves, and by their Repreſentatives in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well <hi>Conjunctim</hi> as <hi>Diviſim,</hi> are his Subjects, and ow Obedience to his Commands.</p>
               <p>To Legiſlation and Judicature, which are ſolely and ſupremely in the King, is neceſſary the Power of the Sword (without which all other Power is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) for forcing Obedience to the Laws, and Judgments given both in Criminal and Civil Cauſes. This, having in virtue of their Soveraignty been alwayes indiſputably enjoyed by the Monarchs of this Nation till the time of the late Rebellion, was ſince his Majeſties Reſtauration by a Parliament, as truly zealous for the happineſs of their King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as ever this Nation ſaw, in proper and expreſs Terms declared to be the Right of the King only without either of his Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the contrary Poſition thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, aſſerted by the rebellious Members of the Parliament of 1640. having been the chief Means of overturning our Government, and bringing Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95482:119"/> and Miſery upon this flouriſhing Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Divinity.</note>So great was the Veneration, ſhewn to the ancient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperors by their Subjects, that they gave them (tho imperfectly only and Analogically) the Titles of <hi>Your Everlaſtingneſs, Your Divinity,</hi> and the like, belonging eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and perfectly to GOD alone: Who, to ſhew the great Power, by him given to Soveraign Princes, and to beget in the Hearts of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an higher Eſteem, and more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Awfulneſs of them, which failing, all Confuſion, Impiety and Calamity break in upon a Nation, is himſelf pleaſed, as is manifeſt in Holy Writ, to beſtow upon them the Title of Gods, as being his Vicegerents, and repreſenting his Majeſty and Power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</p>
               <p>Nay ſo exceſſive was the Reſpect of the good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe times, that they were wont to ſwear by the Majeſty of their Emperor, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſometimes did by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> And this Cuſtom ſeems to be juſtified by <hi>Vegetus,</hi> a learned Writer of that Age, being practiced only to create in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95482:119"/> the Subjects a greater Reverence for theſe Earthly Deities.</p>
               <p>In like manner the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of this Monarchy attribute to the King, whom they regard as GOD upon Earth, divers Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which belong properly to none but GOD. Thus as GOD is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſo the Law will have no Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection found in the King: No Negligence, no Folly, no Infamy, or Corruption of Blood, all former Attainders (tho even made by Act of Parliament) being <hi>ipſo facto</hi> purged by the Acceſſion of the Crown.</p>
               <p>To the King is attributed Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Juſtice in the Abſtract: <hi>The King cannot erre; The King can do no wrong.</hi> To the King is likewiſe aſcribed a Kind of Immortality: <hi>The King never dies;</hi> as being a Corporation in himſelf, that lives for ever: For all <hi>Interregna</hi> being unknown in theſe Kingdoms, the ſame Moment, that one King dies, the next Heir is fully and abſolutely King without any Coronation, Ceremony, or Act to be done.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:95482:120"/>
               <p>The King is alſo in ſome ſort ſaid to be Omnipreſent. He is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner every where, in all his Courts of Juſtice, in all his Palaces: Therefore it is, that all his Subjects ſtand bare in the Preſence Chamber, whereſoever the Chair of State is placed, tho the King be many Miles diſtance from thence.</p>
               <p>He hath alſo a kind of Univerſal Influence over all his Dominions. His Fatherly Care is extended to preſerve, feed, inſtruct and defend the whole Commonweal. His War, His Peace, His Courts of Juſtice, and all His Acts of Soveraignty tend only to preſerve and diſtribute to every perſon within his Territories their particular Rights and Priviledges.</p>
               <p>By his Power of creating to the higheſt Dignity, and annihilating the ſame at pleaſure; and much more by his Prerogative of pardoning thoſe, whom the Law has condemned, he is inveſted with a kind of Omnipotency, whereby he can reſtore to life thoſe, that are dead in Law. And this Power of pardoning condemned Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals is of ſuch Benefit to the Lives and Eſtates of the People, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95482:120"/> it many would be expoſed to die unjuſtly.</p>
               <p>The King alone in his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions can ſay with GOD, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative he is, <hi>Vengeance is Mine:</hi> For all Puniſhments proceed from him in ſome of his Courts of Juſtice, it not being lawful for any Subject to avenge himſelf.</p>
               <p>The King alone is Judge in his own Cauſe, tho he delivers his Judgment by the Mouth of his Judges.</p>
               <p>But in nothing doth the King more reſemble the eternal Deity, than in the Plenitude of his Power to do, what he pleaſes, without being oppoſed, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or queſtioned by his Subjects. <hi>Nemo quidem</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bracton) de factis ejus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumat diſputare, multo minus contra fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ejus ire.</hi> Let none preſume to ſearch into his deeds, much leſs to oppoſe them.

               </head>
               <p>THE Monarch of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> has Right to the Imperial Crown of this Iſland by Inheritance, according to the Laws of GOD and Nature, and the fundamental Conſtitutions of the Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which both agree in this, That, upon the Death of the King, the next of Kindred, tho born out of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95482:126"/> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> or born of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, not Subjects of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> is immediately King before any Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Coronation, Publication, or Conſent of Peers or People.</p>
               <p>The Rule of Inheritance, given by GOD himſelf to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is this: <hi>If a man dy, and have no Son, then he ſhall cauſe his Inheritance to paſs unto his Daughter. And if he have no Daughter, then ye ſhall give his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto his Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Agreeably to which Rule, the Crown of <hi>Great Britain</hi> deſcends, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable Heritage, from the Father to the eldeſt Son and his Heirs; for want of Sons, to the Eldeſt Daughter, and her Heirs; for want of Daughters to the Brother and his Heirs; and for want of Brethren, to the Siſter and her Heirs.</p>
               <p>And ſo unalterable is this Courſe of Deſcent, that no Act, no Crime, no Attainder of Treaſon, can bar the next of Blood from being King in the inſtant of Time, his Predeceſſor does not ſo much dye, as by a State-<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempſychoſis</hi> tranſmit his Life, his Breath, or his Soul into the Noſtrils, the Body of his Succeſſor.</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:95482:127"/>
               <p>For Hereditary Monarchy being (as it has been clearly demonſtrated) an immediate Ordinance of GOD, founded in the Prime Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the Laws of GOD and Nature being (as all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) abſolutely immutable, it is a Madneſs to think, that any Act of Parliament can change this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Law, or, with the leaſt Color of Juſtice, alter the Right of Succeſſion.</p>
               <p>This was well known to all our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Parliaments, that were neither over-awed by any prevailing Faction ſeduced by deſigning Intreaguers, nor yet vainly flattered themſelves with an Omnipotent Power to create and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate Kings: In one of which the States of the Realm unanimouſly anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered King <hi>Edward</hi> the IIId. asking their Advice in matters, relating to the Crown: <hi>That they could not conſent to any thing in Parliament, that tended to the Diſheriſon of the King, and his Heirs, or the Crown, whereunto they were ſworn.</hi> From whence Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> concludes, <hi>That it is a Law and Cuſtom of Parliament, that no King can alien the Crown from the right Heir, tho by conſent of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95482:127"/> Lords and Commons.</hi> And elſewhere affirming King <hi>Johns</hi> Reſignation of the Crown to the Pope to have been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void, he alledges this Reaſon: <hi>Becauſe the Royal Dignity is an Inherent inſeparable to the Royal Blood of the King, deſcendable to the next of Blood to the King, and cannot be tranſferd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And altho by the Treaſons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies of ambitious, diſloyal, and deſigning Perſons, the Crown has now and then been transferred from one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to another, yet does it appear in Story, that ſince the time of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt the right Heir was never yet kept out beyond the ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent. And to the Honor of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliaments we can aver, that never any Uſurper (tho armed with Power) laid claim to the Crown in Parliament, but by pretending to be of the Right Line; nor did ever the Parliament al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of ſuch Pretence, if falſe, but when awed by Fear and a vaſt Army. And whenever, the Terror of ſuch armed violence being removed, the true Heir was enabled to claim his Right, the Parliament, notwithſtanding all ſuch pretended Acts, readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95482:128"/> themſelves to their legitimate Prince, as being bound thereunto by the Laws of GOD and Nature.</p>
               <p>Thus altho <hi>Henry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> backt by an Army of fourty or fifty thouſand men, under Pretence of a feigned Title from <hi>Edmund Crouch-back,</hi> forced his Natural Soveraign, King <hi>Richard</hi> the IId. firſt to reſign, and afterwards to be depoſed from his Crown, which, waving his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pretended Title, he cauſed to be entailed upon himſelf, his four Sons, and the Heirs of their Bodies, by Act of Parliament, whereby he thought to have ſecured it to his Poſterity for ever; Yet, notwithſtanding theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Proviſions, ſeconded by, the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and prodigious Succeſs of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the Vth. when in the year 1460. this Entail was alledged againſt <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> laying claim in Parliament to the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as being the next Heir to <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>

                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:95482:128"/> England <hi>and</hi> France <hi>by Title of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Deſcent, or Succeſſion, he neither needed, nor would have deſired, or made them to be granted to him in ſuch wiſe, as they be by that Act: Which</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>taketh no place, neither is of any force, or effect againſt him, that is right Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the ſaid Crowns, as accordeth with the Laws of GOD, and all Natural Laws.</hi> Which Anſwer of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and h s Claim to the Crown, was by the ſame Parliament expreſly recognized and declared to be <hi>Good, True, Juſt, Lawful,</hi> and <hi>Sufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when in the ſame year <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> eldeſt Son to the ſaid Duke of <hi>York,</hi> upon the death of his Father, took poſſeſſion of the Crown by the Name of King <hi>Edward</hi> the IVth. his Title was in full Parliament by all acknowledged in theſe Words: <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo certainly, and without doubt and ambiguity, that by GODs Law, and the Law of Nature, He</hi> (viz. the ſaid King <hi>Edward) and none other, is, and ought to be true, R ghtwiſe, and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Liege and Soveraign Lord: And that he was in right, from the Death of the ſaid Noble and Fam us Prinee his Father, very juſt King of the ſame Realm of</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:95482:129"/> England. And ſo little Reſpect was given to the aforementioned Act of Entail, that it was not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, being eſteemed from the very beginning null and void in it ſelf. Nor indeed were any Acts of <hi>Henry</hi> the IVth. Vth. or VIth. (ſtiled <hi>Kings in Deed and not of Right</hi>) deemed to be in force, but ſuch, as were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly confirmed by <hi>Edward</hi> the IVth. in the ſame manner, as his Sacred Majeſty, now reigning, confirmed the judicial Proceedings of the late Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>As little Succeſs had that Monſter of Nature, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who, being by the Intereſt of ſeveral factious Lords choſen Protector to his Nephew, the young King <hi>Edward</hi> the Vth &amp; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by that means gotten into his hands the military Force of the Nation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that the Children of his Brother King <hi>Edward</hi> the IVth. were illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, laid claim to the Crown, which he not only entailed by Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament upon himſelf and his Iſſue, but the better to ſecure it in his Line, cauſed the Innocent young King, and his only Brother, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to be barbarouſly murthered in the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95482:129"/> Tower; yet did he within three years loſe both his Crown and Life to <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> on whom and his Heirs it was again by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment entailed, which yet would little have availed him or his Poſterity, had he not prudently (acording to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by which ſeveral of the Nobility were induced to aſſiſt him) married <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldeſt Daughter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the IVth. and immediate Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of the Crown, whereby, happily turning his Uſurpation into a lawful Sovereignty, he ſecured himſelf in the Throne.</p>
               <p>But that his Iſſue by any other Lady could not have had better Succeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Princely Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> than <hi>Adonijah</hi> had againſt <hi>Salomon,</hi> may more than probably be preſumed, if we ſhall conſider, what Fate attended the many mad Acts, made by <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth about the Succeſſion.</p>
               <p>This haughty Prince, whoſe caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humor none of his Parliaments durſt gainſay, having after above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years Cohabitation divorced his Queen, a chaſt and vertuous Lady, did in the twenty fifth year of his Reign diſinherit by Act of Parliament the

               <p>Nor can any man be blamed for apprehending, that ſome ſuch thing might be aimed at by the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors of the Bill for excluding his Royal Highneſs from the Succeſſion, if it ſhall be conſidered, that the chief Sticklers for that Bill inſiſted on the Depoſition of <hi>Edward</hi> the IId. contrived by a leacherous Queen and diſloyal Parliament, and that of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>

               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:95482:133"/>
               <p>But well fare the noble Lords of <hi>England,</hi> who (with a <hi>Nolumus Leges</hi> Angliae <hi>mutari</hi>) rejected that abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bill; which, tho it would, if paſſed into an Act, have been of no greater Force or Validity, than the Wild Ordinances of the Rebellious Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 1640. yet might it (as they were) be made uſe of to induce the deluded Multitude to hazard their Souls, Bodies, and Eſtates by a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oppoſition of their Lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and to raiſe up a Conteſt in this Nation, not unlike to the old <hi>Yorkiſh</hi> and <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Quarrel, the Thoughts whereof every good man muſt certainly dread, when he ſhall ſeriouſly conſider, how that War laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about ſixty years, and coſt the Kingdom its whole Treaſure, and the Lives of above two hundred thouſand of the Commons, beſides ſeveral Kings and Princes, and Nobles without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>So ſenſible was the renowned Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of thoſe fatal Conſequences, which neceſſarily attend ſo unjuſt an Act, as that of altering the Succeſſion, that, altho for Reaſons obvious enough (and needleſs here to be
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95482:133"/> mentioned) ſhe yeilded to paſs an Act, whereby it was made Treaſon to ſay, that ſhe and her Parliament could not diſpoſe of the Crown, yet could ſhe never be brought to give her Conſent to the actual diſpoſing thereof, tho the next Heir, then alive, was not only a Papiſt, but her own Rival to the Throne. Nay ſhe was ſo averſe to any ſuch Act, that (as <hi>Camden</hi> tells us) <hi>She never heard any thing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, than that the Title of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be called into queſtion. And therefore ſhe ſent Mr.</hi> Thornton <hi>Reader of Law in</hi> Lincolns-Inn, <hi>to the Tower, becauſe in his Reading he called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>Title to the Crown.</hi> And when the Lord Keeper <hi>Bacon</hi> was accuſed by the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> for having intermedled againſt the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Right to the Succeſſion, and for being privy to a Book, wherein <hi>Hales</hi> went about to derive the Title of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in caſe the Queen ſhould die without Iſſue, to the Houſe of <hi>Suffolk, Hales</hi> was therefore committed to the Tower, and <hi>Bacon,</hi> tho denying it, was not without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty reſtored to favor. So likewiſe, when in the eighth year of her Reign, <hi>Bell
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95482:134"/> Mounſon,</hi> and a great Number of the Houſe of Commons, thought it their Right, as Repreſentatives of the whole Kingdom, whereof they do not in reality repreſent the ſixth part, to decide &amp; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Succeſſion, the Queen by a Prince-like Speech in the Parliament-Houſe ſpeedily ſuppreſſed their Inſolence. In like manner when in the thirty fifth year of her Reign Mr. <hi>Peter Wentworth</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bromley</hi> delivered a Petition to the Lord Keeper, deſiring the Lords of the Upper Houſe to be Suppliants with them of the Lower to Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for entailing the Succeſſion of the Crown, for which they had a Bill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy drawn, the Queen highly diſpleaſed hereat, charged her Councel to call the Parties before them: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir <hi>Thomas Henage,</hi> ſending for them, commanded them to forbear the Parliament, and not to go out of their ſeveral Lodgings. They were after called before the Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Lord <hi>Buckhurſt,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Henage,</hi> by whom <hi>Wentworth</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower, Sir <hi>Henry Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and other Members of the Houſe of Commons, to whom he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the matter, being ſent to the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95482:134"/> 
                  <hi>Fleet.</hi> So careful was this prudent Queen to keep the People from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to intermeddle with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
               <p>The ſame Conſideration, that the <hi>Altering or Diverting the Succeſſion</hi> in an hereditary Monarchy, where <hi>the Kings (deriving their Royal Power from GOD Almighty alone) do ſucceed lineally</hi> to the Crown, <hi>according to the known De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Proximity in Blood, cannot be attempted without involving the Subjects in Perjury and Rebellion, and expoſing of them to all the Fatal and Dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of a Civil War,</hi> not only cauſed the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their very laſt Seſſions of Parliament, <hi>from an hearty and ſincere Sence of their Duty to recognize, acknowledge, and declare, That the Right to the Imperial Crown of that Realm is (by the Inherent Right, and the Nature of the Monarchy, as well as by the Fundamental and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Laws of the Realm) tranſmitted and devolved by a Lineal Succeſſion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proximity of Blood; And that upon the Death of the King or Queen, who actually Reigns, the Subjects of that Kingdom are bound by Law, Duty and Allegiance to obey the next immediate and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95482:135"/> lawful Heir, either Male or Female, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the Right and Adminiſtration of Government is immediately devolved; And that no Difference in Religion, nor no Law, nor Act of Parliament, made, or to be made, can alter or divert the Right of Succeſſion and Lineal Deſcent of the Crown to the neareſt and lawful Heir, according to the Degrees aforeſaid; nor can ſtop or hinder them in the full, free and actual Adminiſtration of the Government, according to the Laws of the Kingdom;</hi> but obliged alſo His Majeſty, for the preſervation of the Peace and Tranquillity of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>with Advice and Conſent of the ſaid Eſtates of Parliament, to declare, That it is High Treaſon in any of the Subjects of that Kingdom, by Writing, Speaking, or any other manner of way, to endeavor the Alteration, Suſpenſion, or Diverſion of the ſaid Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or the debarring the next lawful Succeſſor from the immediate, actual, full, and free Adminiſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it to be doubted, but that the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> who now begin to grow ſenſible of thoſe Precipices of Ruine, whereinto they were ready to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95482:135"/> tumble through the Contrivances of of thoſe malicious Incendiaries, that by terrifying the People with panick Fears of Popery and Arbitrary Power endeavoured to kindle a Fire of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Nation, will, whenever it ſhall pleaſe His Majeſty to call a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſhew themſelves no leſs Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous (than the <hi>Scots</hi> have done) to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and defend (according to their Oaths) the Kings Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the chiefeſt whereof, upon which all the reſt depend, as on a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Stone, is the unalterable Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs of the Monarchy, and thereby defeat the Deſignes of thoſe curſed <hi>Achitophels,</hi> who labor by involving us in Confuſion to eſtabliſh their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Democracy, the very worſt of Tyrannies.</p>
